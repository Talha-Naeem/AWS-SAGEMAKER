__label__positive__ sometimes a generic battery works , but i prefer to buy the nikon battery for more assurance of durability and lasting power . i always carry an extra for extended photo shoots .
__label__positive__ gave me the confidence that our new underwater camera would not be lost while snorkeling .
__label__negative__ great camera , but so far it only works when plugged into my wireless router ? i went through the process of adding wifi password and what not , got the blinking green arrow then disconnected it as it said to . it does n't work when i disconnect it and resets itself as well ... tried the reset button with no luck . call the customer support line , only to be told i would receive a call back today or tomorrow ? ? who does that ? ? if i do n't hear back i will be returning this to possibly order a new one ? !
__label__positive__ stellar supplier ... highly recommended. < br / > thanks !
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ this is the updated version of this model ... x5c-1 . this is apparently a significant upgrade over the original model in terms of flight characteristics . i have no experience with the original model , though. < br / > < br / > the unit comes with a set of spare propellers , the remote control , one battery , a usb charger , the camera , propeller guards , landing skids , a memory card , usb memory card adapter , and the drone . it 's a good looking copter , and is built reasonably well for the price . the landing skids and propeller guards are a nice addition , and the skids are required if you 're using the camera . the skids pop on and off easily , however the prop guards are attached via a screw that seems to easily strip out the plastic screw hole , so be careful . the prop guards are not easily added and removed due to this screw hole issue , so i 'd recommend leaving them attached . they add some weight , but not so much as to seriously affect the flight time . the camera itself is small , and not particularly good . this is a good drone if you 're a relatively new flyer , and want to try some rudimentary photography . the camera will reduce the flight time of the drone , as it draws power to operate from the onboard battery . the camera is activated , either in video or still mode , from a button on the controller . the camera itself will blink based on the capture of a still , or capture of video . this is a nice feature , however the light is hard to see during the day . it would have been nice if they 'd included some kind of indication on the remote control that a still was captured , or that a video was being captured . images and video are stored on the included microsd card , which fits inside the camera via an externally accessible slot. < br / > < br / > the drone has led lights on the underside of the unit , green for rear and orange for front . this does make it easy to see if the drone is facing forward or away , however these lights can be hard to see in direct sun , so i 'd recommend some tape or other highly visible indicator on the rearward nacelles , to help in bright sun. < br / > < br / > the drone is well built , and being a city-dweller , i fly in parking lots more than open fields , and have hard-landed or crashed the copter a number of times . on the grass , it 's no big deal ... on the pavement , it does start to take its toll . thus far , after a few hours of flying time , things seems to be holding up well . one interesting characteristic of the drone is that when you do land hard on the pavement , the bounciness of the skids almost guarantees the drone will end up upside down . this is a bit annoying ... seems like it 's almost designed to do this , though i 'm sure it 's not the case ... i 'd guess about 95 % of the time , if you land hard , it 'll flip over. < br / > < br / > the flight characteristics are pretty good , and the unit flies with good stability . a cool feature of the drone is that you can & # 34 ; throw & # 34 ; it into the air , and then hit the throttle , at which point it 'll right itself and hover for a second before the controller actives ... or this is how it seems . it 's pretty impressive that such a low-cost drone can do this , and it 's fun to throw the thing into the air and watch it right itself . the & # 34 ; eversion & # 34 ; button works as you 'd expect from a syma ... allows for 360 flipping of the drone in any direction . the controller provides for trim adjustments , in case the drone is noticeably wandering forward/back/left/right . there is no auto-hover function , and it actually is very difficult to get the unit to hover completely motionless by using the controls/trims . i have n't measured the controller range , though i 've found it perfectly adequate for my flying , which generally does n't exceed 150 feet , or so. < br / > < br / > the included battery is a 500mah ; i purchased some 600mah third-party units , and they work very well and provide a noticeably longer flight time . the batteries are a bit of a pain to connect and disconnect , and you need to be very careful not to pull too hard on the battery leads , or you 'll have a micro-soldering project on your hands . the third-party batteries seem to have much tighter battery connections , so be careful. < br / > < br / > overall , for $ 50 , this is nice unit , and well-suited to a beginning flyer , or someone that wants a slightly more advanced drone with basic camera functions . extra batteries are a must , however , as the included stock battery lasts about 5 mins , and the 3rd party batteries only a couple minutes longer . this is , of course , based on how you 're flying it , winds , camera use , etc.l too hard on the battery leads , or you 'll have a micro-soldering project on your hands . the third-party batteries seem to have much tighter battery connections , so be careful. < br / > < br / > overall , for $ 50 , this is nice unit , and well-suited to a beginning flyer , or someone that wants a slightly more advanced drone with basic camera functions . extra batteries are a must , however , as the included stock battery lasts about 5 mins , and the 3rd party batteries only a couple minutes longer . this is , of course , based on how you 're flying it , winds , camera use , etc .
__label__positive__ i could not believe all the equipment i received for the money ! typically i would spend the money for one piece .
__label__negative__ narrow , no padding , cheap & ratty looking , loose threads
__label__negative__ the hood interferes with the photo , the threads are not made good , and makes it impossible to take a uv filter off . others have commented the same . i contacted the seller , and got no reply . trying to get the uv filter ( $ 29.00 ) bought at the same time , off , broke . so now i have to buy the filter again , and i have no hood . there is no way this lens fits the nikon 18-55 lens as advertised
__label__positive__ good quality photos , light weight , stylish . it is what i wanted .
__label__positive__ excellent ! !
__label__positive__ works great and it 's a lifesaver .
__label__negative__ video quality very poor . see for yourself before making purchase decision. < br / > https : //app.box.com/s/nxk36fuhqdkcyn1x3iugq1hklo0rzu3d < br / > recorded at 720p 60fps < br / > a family member purchased 1 for me and i was about to place order for another one for bicycle but after viewing few recorded video , due to poor video quality , will be returning it .
__label__negative__ at first it seemed too good to be true , because it is . upon closer inspection , it was obvious that the parts are poorly made . monopod/selfie-stick did n't lock , so that made it unusable .
__label__positive__ i did a lot of searching and looking through reviews before deciding on this purchase . it 's a great piece of kit . just be aware that it does n't come with lens cleaning fluid if that 's what you are looking to have . for what you get it 's great value .
__label__positive__ this is a fantastic little shutter release . the main reason i purchased this was the intervallometer function and extra long exposure times . my camera , the sony slt-a58 , has no built-in interval system , and has limited exposure times of 30 seconds. < br / > i have shot several long exposure star timelapses with great results . i also like that you do not even need batteries to use the shutter release function ; simply plug into the camera and press the shutter button ( which does have a half-depression for auto focus ) to start an exposure . the shutter button also has a locking switch that allows for indefinite exposures while the camera is in bulb mode. < br / > < br / > the device is quite easy to program : < br / > 1 ) press set < br / > 2 ) navigate menus with & # 60 ; and & # 62 ; buttons < br / > 3 ) change values ( delay start , exposure time , interval , number of shots , and audio signals ) with up and down buttons < br / > 4 ) press set ( optional : hold light/lock button to lock the device as to not change any settings ) < br / > 5 ) press start to begin the exposure ( s ) < br / > < br / > the one thing i do not like about this shutter release , is that it does not have a power button . i have read that the power consumption of this device is so eensy weensy , that when idle it would take up to 2 years to drain the two aaa batteries . it is comparable to those lcd bedside clocks . i fixed this & # 34 ; problem & # 34 ; by taking a small plastic tab ( saved from the battery compartment of another device ) and inserted it between the batteries and the contacts . i do not need to do this but it just makes me feel better about storing this in my camera case for long periods of time. < br / > < br / > this is definitely worth the money !
__label__positive__ these work well in my sony nex 6 camera . they do not last quite as long as the oem battery but they are of sufficient capacity that it 's not much of an issue . getting two for the price of one oem battery makes it a complete non-issue .
__label__positive__ love it !
__label__positive__ each oem battery is around $ 25 . to get two and a charger for the price i paid is a great deal . it arrived quickly . the batteries charged and worked perfectly .
__label__positive__ looks real
__label__positive__ works great i have taken this on leave with me and always have a charged battery .
__label__positive__ work really good
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ boy ! does this camera remind me of my old polaroid square shooter . this camera is nothing like your iphone camera as it 's big , and totally analog except for the film counter on the back . i love it when the motor runs and film comes sliding out - a sound i well remember . i think the hardest thing about using this camera was getting the shoulder strap put on , other than that it 's very easy to use . though it is on the big side , it does n't weigh much and the view finder and shutter button are pretty much intuitive . i 'm left handed so holding it like a right-hander took a little getting used too , but it 's not a problem for me . this camera is made for right-handers so those who are very much left-handed might not like the way you have to hold it , and the shutter button is on the right side front . it has flash and you can adjust the light/dark and distance to you subject with minimal effort. < br / > < br / > loading the film was easy , aiming at my subject was easy , the shutter button was easy to depress and everything is/was easy . the close-up adapter looks like there 's no way it will attach itself to the lens , but somehow it does . i took one close-up of my dog but the picture did n't turn out very good because she moved away right when i hit the shutter button-but that 's typical for her . i have n't taken a & # 34 ; selfie & # 34 ; yet but it seems like it will be easy to do. < br / > < br / > the color development of the film is pretty good . i took a wide angle picture of my raised garden beds and i was able to get all of them in the picture and the various green colors were vivid . i also took a picture of the front of our house , and though i had to still walk across the street to our neighbor 's driveway to get the entire house in the view finder , the picture turned out nice . again , the colors were bright and vivid . it got the entire house plus some area on both sides . in the past with my other cameras i would have to get further away or be happy with just most of the house in the picture so it 's real nice to get the whole thing with room to spare. < br / > < br / > the film is kind of pricey . for a pack of 40 pictures it costs around $ 34.00 . i figured it would be kind of expensive and i hope the price of the film goes down some . this is a comfort camera for those of us who grew up with polaroids . it may be that since we are living in highly uncertain and stressful times , having a camera like this is a cool blast from the past and may make us just feel better having one like this , plus it takes nice pictures.e picture so it 's real nice to get the whole thing with room to spare. < br / > < br / > the film is kind of pricey . for a pack of 40 pictures it costs around $ 34.00 . i figured it would be kind of expensive and i hope the price of the film goes down some . this is a comfort camera for those of us who grew up with polaroids . it may be that since we are living in highly uncertain and stressful times , having a camera like this is a cool blast from the past and may make us just feel better having one like this , plus it takes nice pictures .
__label__positive__ got to use it a couple times i really like it
__label__positive__ these are just the perfect size for so many little tasks . i have three pairs of glasses , and i can keep one with each pair . husband has two pairs of glasses , and can do the same . i make beaded jewelry , and these are great for polishing up a finished piece and getting all the fingerprints off of it . the price point is so good that i 'm thinking of handing them out with show purchases when i get my beaded jewelry business off the ground .
__label__neutral__ great camera , but this is my second panasonic camera with a leica lens that has jammed beyond repair .
__label__positive__ this is a perfect case for the phantom 3 pro plus lots of extra room for whatever else you want to carry around this very well built case is a little on the heavy side but do n't mind a little extra weight when it comes to protecting my investment
__label__positive__ eco2 series is easy to setup , pretty much plug and play . the hardest part would be to configure remote viewing which is n't that bad as long as you know how to setup port forwarding on your modem and router. < br / > < br / > the user interface is simple , nothing fancy. < br / > < br / > the cameras that come with the system are okay at best . plastic housing and the mounts tend to slowly move downwards .
__label__positive__ can you use this for fishing in a boat ?
__label__positive__ this is just barely long enough to fit an alienbees strobe ceiling mounted , which is exactly what i wanted to do with it . far less expensive than other options , add a few of these to your studio even if you do n't have a use for them yet -- they 'll come in handy .
__label__positive__ great filter , exactly as i expected . most likely will buy a couple more ... .
__label__positive__ great deal . fast shipping .
__label__positive__ it holds up well to the nikon brand . i have been very pleased .
__label__positive__ it works well with canon 5dii ; but it lacks the shoe to attach to the camera , i would reduce it to 4 stars .
__label__neutral__ so far only 2 of the batteries hold a charge . will update later .
__label__neutral__ this is a good telescope for beginners . the mount is rock solid and settles quickly , even at higher magnifications . i had fun observing the moon , the sun ( with the supplied full-aperture filter ) , and planets at lower magnifications . i never tried looking at stars. < br / > < br / > i am probably being too hard on this scope by giving it three stars , but i bought this scope hoping that it was a close cousin to the standalone sky-watcher maksutov-cassegrain 90mm . it 's a distant relation . the rear of telescope is incased , preventing collimation . the factory collimation is good enough for lower power viewing & # 60 ; 50x , but not good enough for observing the moon , the sun , or planets at higher magnifications. < br / > < br / > also , the tracking is a bit imprecise . objects drift from view within 15 seconds when using the 10mm eyepiece . this is certainly better than no tracking , and the scope settles quickly enough that adjusting the position is only a small distraction . i was hoping to use the telescope to perform simple planetary , lunar , and solar astrophotography by capturing avis then using registax , but the tracking is n't tight enough . as a point of comparison , my cheap meade ds2090 goto scope tracks very well , but its mount and optics are too sloppy for any type of photography. < br / > < br / > i was hoping to spend a little more money to get a better mount and better optics over the ds2090 , which i did , but the imprecise tracking and lack of collimation adjustments forced me to return the scope .
__label__positive__ great item !
__label__positive__ great build . much better than gary fong lightsphere . you would think the velcro would n't hold up but it actually stays up . this is a great product especially , very flexible from macro , portrait , to group shots this met all my needs . would definitely buy again .
__label__positive__ needed charger that works car . works.as.advertised .
__label__positive__ for the amount this cost with basically similar products to what gopro try 's to sell you , you 're getting a great deal . that 's all that needs to be said . i use the open black housing and suction cup mount most . the name brand suction mount goes for 40 $ so i 'm satisfied i got much more . all items do fit into the blue drawstring knapsack provided . there is a little bit of a plastic smell but nothing overwhelming . i 've used the gorilla mount , although not super strong and it is quite small , roughly 6 inch tall , you can still maneuver it onto small posts or railings and such . do n't hesitate to buy this for the amateur gopro user . it 's a must have < br / > < br / > update 1 : < br / > broke the bike mount . used it about three times and the bending from tightening and loosening constantly made the plastic snap . id recommend grabbing a metal handlebar mount if you are solely looking to use your go pro on your bike . i wanted to make sure it was tight enough that my expensive go pro would n't fly off . too tight !
__label__positive__ had great service today from employee badge no . ar004214 , would recommend this co , and product
__label__positive__ have used the flotation device many times and has not failed . chest harness was used during an extremely taxing game of paintball in the woods and was neither uncomfortable nor in the way . materials are very sturdy and i really appreciate the fact that it was n't overpriced like other gopro accessories one finds online .
__label__positive__ nice strong little tripod
__label__positive__ all i did was set up the mosition sensors at first , cause i was in a hurry to set it up and leave with some peace of mind . then came back and started to put the rest of it up . its easy any dome as* can do , and if not they have a hot line that you call and they walk you throu it 123 and you are done
__label__positive__ great price . allows simple remote shutter operation ( even without batteries ) and programmable intervalometer function for doing time lapse work . the plastic cover over the screen has fallen off on mine but it 's been tossing around my camera bag unprotected for a couple years now so i ca n't say it is n't my fault . the cover is necessary though otherwise you ca n't see which parameter you 're setting. < br / > worked on my a57 as well as my new a77ii. < br / > < br / > bonus tip ! : how to do a timelapse even if your batteries are dead : i took this into the colorado backcountry once to do milky way time lapse . after having some fun doing other long exposure/night photography i went to set things up for a timelapse and discovered the aaa batteries in my remote were dead and i did n't have spares . but guess what ? ? i found a trick to get around that ! ! my camera was set manually for 30 second exposures . so all i did was press the shutter button on the remote and slide the lock thing on to hold it down . this caused the camera to take it 's 30 second exposure then activated another as soon as the camera was ready . same effect as using a rubber band and pencil eraser to hold the shutter button down . saved my butt though ! < br / > < br / > heres the timelapse i did ( if amazon allows ) : https : //youtu.be/kwfkv9uhyem
__label__positive__ good service . i 'd totally recommend them to anyone
__label__positive__ purchased from emmy photo , fulfilled by amazon. < br / > this is a grey market lens , hence the great deal and the fact that emmy photo includes a 7 year mac warranty . at first , i was put off when i tried to register my warranty and found the lens was & # 34 ; grey & # 34 ; . i voiced my concern to emmy photo customer service and they responded immediately , explaining that the lens was indeed originally distributed to canada . they assured me that the mac warranty would cover the lens for usa repair , and also offered to have me return the lens for a full refund with no questions asked. < br / > so i decided to check the lens out , and it is perfect ! i actually did lab and field tests , ensuring i was level and at 90 degrees to the subject on both planes , shooting at all focal lengths and apertures , using both a resolution chart and a brick wall ( very scientific , that ) and if there is anything wrong with this lens , i sure ca n't tell . performance was precisely as noted by the professional testers , with the expected vignetting and barrel distortion at the expected settings ... in other words , my sample is perfect and i saved a bunch of $ $ ! your mileage may vary , but i feel compelled to applaud emmy photo for their professionalism and excellent responsiveness to my concerns . they took a potentially poor experience and turned it completely around. < br / > as for the tamron sp 24-70mm di vc lens - for the difference in price vs. the overall performance of this lens , to me it is a no-brainer that you 're getting better value than you would purchasing the manufacturer 's lens . for the purists out there that want nothing but l series or nikkor glass , i get it . if money were no object for me , i might be right there with you . i am aware that nikon has released a vr version of this lens and i am sure it is a fine lens , but for me , the difference in cost is significant enough to go with tamron. < br / > all that being said , the tamron sp 24-70mm di vc usd is razor sharp , focuses quickly and without hesitation , and is nicely constructed - great lens ! < br / > updated to respond to the & # 34 ; pros & # 34 ; who bash the performance of this lens ... while many of your comments have merit , as others have said , the value proposition can not be ignored . i bought my sample as a gray box with a 7-year mac warranty for $ 800 total . for $ 800 you ca n't touch this lens . for perspective , i am also very picky about my gear and do give full quarter to your concerns regarding iq when wide open . however , as with most zooms the sweet spot will lie in the 5.6-ish part of the range and this is no exception.it really all depends on what you want to use the lens for , and since i 'm primarily a landscape , macro , still life shooter , this lens fits the bill easily . it also has the low light capability of f2.8 , and i have had no issues with image quality shooting wide open . i have paired it with a nikon d750 , and after almost a year , am still quite pleased with this purchase .
__label__positive__ excellent ! bought for a trip that i needed a good backpack and a sturdy camera case . it was perfect ! excellent size and width ! definitely recommend !
__label__positive__ took this for a day at the beach . picture quality remained consistently good throughout recording sessions . fps was better than i expected ( ~30 solid fps ) . microphone quality was also excellent . picked up conversation clearly without being distorted by waves . sidenote , the built in speaker is very weak . view videos on computer for best a/v quality . overall great value for money . definitely on par with name brand gopro .
__label__neutral__ everything but the selfie stick work great . the stick is flimsy and broke after the first use ... it comes apart when i stretch it out . other than that , everything else works great .
__label__positive__ i have pelican cases for a lot of valuable equipment . they never let me down .
__label__positive__ just ideal for the backpack during international travel . dslr with 70mm zoom on , second ultra-wide lens , led with two batteries and charger , strap , dslr charger , all inside . and in the zipper pouch , the critical small accessories . in the mesh side pocket , a pelican memory case . the zipper was critical , and the handle important enough to give this thing more uses than just inside the backpack . atop this insert was a wrapped video fluid head and two pouches with audio and gopro gear . splendid quality to this thing as well. < br / > < br / > money well spent .
__label__positive__ the batteries are great , the charger works , and it was a fraction of the price of the oem version .
__label__positive__ fits some celestron newtonian reflectors but not others . attached it to a canon eos t3 and then to the celestron 127eq and it focuses fine ( even though my eq127 eq is not that sharp after a year of endless fiddling with collimation ) . then connected the same camera & adapter to the very sharp celestron 114eq and it would only focus with a barlow ( a celestron omni 2x barlow eyepiece screwd into the t-adapter base , to be precise ) . same story with the very sharp celestron 80az , that one needs a barlow too to achieve prime focus . disappointing result , since with the barlow the field of view for me is too narrow , and the luminosity too weak for nebulae and galaxies .
__label__neutral__ awkward to use . takes three hands to align the hood properly .
__label__negative__ wrong cord
__label__positive__ it works well but have to be right on your idem to bee looked @
__label__positive__ good product.very easy t use . you can quickly copy all your slides .
__label__positive__ works perfectly . have n't had any issues with this adapter
__label__positive__ this is very sturdy and easy to set up and use . i love that it extends up to eye height for me ( i am 5 ' 5 & # 34 ; )
__label__negative__ it 's ok but takes forever to balance . would n't recommend this to a novice or hobbyist , they would hate stabilizers if this was the first they worked with .
__label__positive__ love this camera but rather intimidated by all it can do . not a beginner 's camera ! will have to buy a book d3200 dummies book to be able to use it .
__label__positive__ camera was good but the bag for camera was too small。。。
__label__negative__ in bought 3 of them and none worked ! ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ a nice camera . really nice ! takes good pictures and the zoom is great .
__label__positive__ as expected aaa
__label__positive__ love it
__label__positive__ i use it all the time on hikes and under water
__label__negative__ much too small to comfortably hold my canon 70d with a 50mm lens . it fits but you have to stretch like mad .
__label__positive__ the spy pen works great . it 's very simple to use once you understand the instructions which can be a little tricky because it only has one button . but that is nescesarry to make it look like a pen . great service from the seller too . : )
__label__positive__ so nice when something actually exceeds your expectations . phenomenal holster bag .
__label__positive__ worked great . having multiple attachments was nice .
__label__positive__ ordered a week before the wedding , worked all night .
__label__positive__ i was looking for a camera for a religious convention i was attending over the july 4th weekend . the camera came right on time ! camera was functional out of the box . video and photo work great ! battery seem to work better than expected !
__label__positive__ great quality ...
__label__positive__ works well , good shipping , rapid .
__label__positive__ i have owned this camera for over two years now and am still very happy with it. < br / > i am no photography expert but i work in the media and need to take a lot of photos . the sony nex-3 exceeds my expectations in image quality and ease of use . the superior auto mode should suffice in most situations . for those willing to put a little effort into learning all the different settings the camera has to offer , you 'll be able to go far beyond basic photography and video. < br / > be aware that the flash does not pop up automatically . you need to push a button to engage the flash regardless of the available light - something i still need to remember on occasion . as others have mentioned , there is no separate battery charger included with this unit , which is not an issue for me but may be for others . it is just as easy to charge the camera via the included micro usb cable but if you like to keep a spare battery , you may want to pick up a separate charger as well. < br / > shutter speed could be a bit faster but i am still able to get decent action shots during sporting events. < br / > this camera is solid and well crafted and definitely a great step into the world of interchangeable lens , mirrorless technology .
__label__positive__ the other reviews have really said it all . i 'm a novice surveillance camera and nas user , so i had more trouble with set up . but the customer service is exceptional . they spent a lot of time talking me through the process . we even skyped for quicker communication . there is quite a time difference since the company is in china , but it did n't hamper progress . it took me about a week to get a good grasp on the operation of this camera and they were there for me every step of the wat and they even got it connected to my nas so i did n't have to call that company . now that i know how the camera operates for the most part , so i have already ordered a second . the installation was a breeze . the photo quality is awesome . i do n't care much for infrared night vision . anything moving is white . you can see enough detail for identifying what it is , but not necessarily who it is . they helped me with this too , and i did get it dialed in better , but it 's still not what i hoped it would be. < br / > these cameras are a new product line , so there are some minor issues to fix yet , but all you have to do is let them know what the problem is , and if they ca n't give you a solution , they will certainly work on it .
__label__positive__ great product , arrived on time . works as described and will get a lot of use out of it .
__label__negative__ the price of the adapter for usa electrical outlet is expensive ( $ 14.99 ) . i do n't like it when i buy an item and ca n't be used right away because there 's a required item that needs to be bought .
__label__negative__ garbage , junk , trash , useless . used once and then trash . wo n't even thread properly . wont work . wo n't work . wo n't work . do not waste your money and time .
__label__neutral__ works but only if directly in front of it .
__label__positive__ i 've been using this tool for 2 years now , and i have to say that it always gives me correct colors straight out of the camera whenever i use it. < br / > < br / > it 's small enough to fit in almost any camera bag , but too large to fit into a pocket . that 's okay , because my camera bag is always close by. < br / > < br / > i find it easier to use than color charts where you shoot a reference image and then have to process images in post . the only downside is that you have to make sure to set white balance before shooting . if you forget , you can set the white balance later , shoot a reference image , and then use the color settings to correct earlier images . ( i always shoot raw for easier post-processing . ) < br / > < br / > with a proper color-managed workflow , the prints that come back from the lab always match the original colors , with no surprises along the way . this means that you 'll also need to color-calibrate your computer monitor , and use color profiles ( particularly srgb ) when sending jpgs to be printed .
__label__positive__ only played with them slightly , but , enjoying them
__label__positive__ great camera great price . shipped quickly
__label__positive__ first the shipping was supposed to take 3 weeks . i got the camera in 5 days . as other have said it was well packaged . the set up is simple . i had some concerns about how the unit would adapt to my existing display , it snapped on with no issue . something i missed in the info when i made the purchase was the camera comes with a g sensor , that 's a nice suprise. < br / > < br / > i 've used several other dash cameras in the past . they cost much more and did far less .
__label__positive__ perfect student camera !
__label__positive__ great products
__label__neutral__ it 's ok however , i do n't use it . i figured out that the side-release plastic buckle is too large for my liking . i need to be able to detach one strap and put on another ; but , i also do n't want to have to push the buckle out of the way when i need to get to that side of my camera .
__label__positive__ it all was withing my expectations
__label__positive__ as a hobbyist i ca n't comment on the technical aspects of this lens , but let me say i love the pictures produced . on my d7000 i use the m mode . you will need to adjust the shutter speed on the camera and the aperture ring on the lens . you will wind up with some pictures over and under exposed as you get used to it , but play around with it and you will get the hang of it in no time . the focus is also manual but i find i dont even touch it very often . you will need to keep the hood properly aligned or it will appear in the borders of you pictures . you will need to put the lens cap on when not in use to prevent scratches on the glass . a fantastic value !
__label__positive__ very nice . everything ok
__label__positive__ this cord is very high quality , durable and a fairly good length .
__label__positive__ lets me take amazing video with shallow depth on a sunny day . i have rokinon t1.5 's + a metabones speedbooster , so an nd system is crucial to even go outside . i use it with the formatt-hitech modular holder .
__label__positive__ excellent value , easy attachment and adjustment .
__label__positive__ perfect ! ! !
__label__positive__ great bag and perfect size !
__label__neutral__ the ttl works well , the modeling light certainly helps . however , there are build quality and design issues . on arrival , one led cover had fallen off . i pushed it back on , but it seems loose . the power pack seems more bulky and heavier than it needs to be . i wish the flash tube diffuser was easily removed to allow for a sharper light .
__label__positive__ so it 's good i like it but it do n't pause so use windows movie maker to merge vids
__label__negative__ you get what you pay for . subpar quality compared to original gopro accessories .
__label__positive__ travelled with this bag to guatemala , turkey and paris . looks the same as the day i bought it . fit nicely under the seat while flying . i use it to carry my nikon d800 , 16-35mm and 24-70mm lenses , assorted filters , memory cards , charger , rain bag and blackrapid kick camera strap ( highly recommend . ) plenty of pocket space for miscellaneous stuff. < br / > bag offers a fair amount of padding , but not a lot . i doubled up some of the padding and used it on the bottom of the case . always carry this bag across my chest to distribute weight . i 'm a pretty small person , so this bag works well for me . it 's a good looking , sturdy shoulder bag that does n't scream camera bag .
__label__neutral__ these work well but they do n't look very appealing . i was able to take pictures and video with ease . however , it does n't record for long .
__label__positive__ works well . however , the ability to support a larger micro sd card would be great . as a pro driver that 's behind the wheel for 10-14 hours a day , i would like it to record a whole day before looping . also , the night vision is just okay . it would be nice if it swith ed it 's setting automatically .
__label__negative__ we purchased this as a baby monitor . it 's a great camera , but the audio is horrible . such a delay . i can hear the baby cry down the hall sometimes 45sec before the audio comes through our ipad . we are going out to buy a plain audio monitor to accompany this camera .
__label__negative__ when i got the dvr it appeared to be ok however when i was taking it out of the box i heard something loose inside the dvr , when i opened the sata port was broken .
__label__negative__ i guess people who gave it 5 stars never had a camera before or never had a good one . i 've had this camera 1 day now and already fuzzy pictures and slow very slow reaction time between pictures . i 'm going to use it for a week and then i 'll see . i 'll probably send it back . it replaces my panasonic d25 which is a good camera but only lasted until the warranty stopped , my luck beautiful nikon camera though . i bought a white one . settings are easy to find ... . good functional buttons on the back ... zoom works good . you would think with all the technology today someone could make a good functional camera . i gave it a two just because i like the look and feel of the camera but if you pay over $ 50 for it you got robbed ... . they deleted my first comment and they will probably delete this one too . that 's ok ... other web sites to post on ... had it two stars but changed it to one star . camera broke yesterday ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i sent it back ... . .
__label__positive__ works
__label__positive__ exactly what i expected and wanted . based on others feedback of the savage swatches , i do agree the actual paper was lighter then pictures but it 's close . i 'd say it 's just not as rich . good quality and packaged to support the large heavy roll .
__label__negative__ looks easy to replace but no it is not ! ! ! the lens is great , when i got it , it was sharp as hell , the problem was putting it back togethher . its almost easier to just get the new one for $ 129 . you are getting a new everything too not just a new lens . and no headaches .
__label__negative__ lasted six month 's . heat might have fried it . other than that it was an ok product 2 stars for the six month 's . but it did it 's job for the price .
__label__positive__ i 've been a serious penny pincher lately and it tore me apart to spend so much on a gps , especially when i can obtain coordinates from my phone . but , truth of the matter is , the places i bring my scope to hardly ever have service , and even when i can get the coordinates myself , they always seem a tad bit off . i 've never been able to get even a decent alignment with my celestron nexstar 6 se . i 'm a complete and absolute beginner and no matter what i do , i 've just never been able to get it. < br / > until i bought this . the wonderful thing about the skysync is that it works everywhere , and everywhere is exactly where i bring my scope . i bought it to bring to different dark parks , and across the country when i go . it is a beautiful thing to just be able to turn the scope on , select daylight savings , align it with 3 totally random bright stars , and have it work so incredibly flawlessly . i bought this scope so i could see some amazing things , and with the skysync , i can see everything so easily because it gives my scope such accurate , on point data . it 's even a lifesaver when it comes to time input- i ca n't possibly set it to the exact second like this can. < br / > everything has to be pretty much perfect for me to be able to see deep sky objects , especially because they are often hard to spot as it is . the first night i brought my scope out with skysync , to a dark park , we got it perfectly aligned on the first try and we were able to see everything . alignment took about 2 minutes and we were able to select items from the menu on our scope- it was able to perfectly point to every single one . i still ca n't get over it . it was so easy and we were able to see it all. < br / > it 's very small , light and durable too . my only complaint , aside from the price , is the location that it 's supposed to sit- it fastenes onto the tripod leg . i often have to unfasten it and place it on the base platform of the tube of the scope because , as my scope moves and turns around , the skysync cord wraps around it ! < br / > so , yes , it 's expensive and a bit overpriced , yes , it really does just input the coordinates and time , yes , you do still have to align it , but it really makes a world of difference . especially if your a beginner like me , that does n't want to deal with the hassle , and the guessing , and the frustration . it 's worth it and makes the entire experience even more enjoyable . i always use the three star align , the others are a little too difficult for me- like i said , i 'm a beginner . i just want to set my scope up and go , and with the skysync , i can , and i can see the most incredible things.s , it 's expensive and a bit overpriced , yes , it really does just input the coordinates and time , yes , you do still have to align it , but it really makes a world of difference . especially if your a beginner like me , that does n't want to deal with the hassle , and the guessing , and the frustration . it 's worth it and makes the entire experience even more enjoyable . i always use the three star align , the others are a little too difficult for me- like i said , i 'm a beginner . i just want to set my scope up and go , and with the skysync , i can , and i can see the most incredible things .
__label__positive__ it works great and it extends and dextends or how ever u say it great ! ! the only problem is that it is made of so.e hard plastic and not metal or something super hard as i thought ! ! but would recommend it to people for a decent selfie stick and it is cheap ! !
__label__positive__ perfect . small and strong .
__label__positive__ nice size , lots of pockets for accessories , sturdy construction , good padding !
__label__positive__ pretty straight forward , they do what they 're supposed to. < br / > these are nice. < br / > would buy again
__label__positive__ does what it advertises . easy to hold and focus using one hand .
__label__negative__ the product came with broken buttons for the up and down menu options . also the watertight cases power/ mode button was broken . a quality control issue but i was still bumbed out because i wanted to use it right away . will order another one and then do another review .
__label__positive__ very nice backdrop .
__label__positive__ unbelievable . love it , love it , love it . very durable , and have had no problems .
__label__positive__ i 'd highly recommend for ease of use and a balanced posture . if you shoot a lot , this is very handy .
__label__positive__ great product , confirtable and great for my drone
__label__negative__ i was quite disappointed with this bag . i was looking for something that would make carrying my everyday gear around a little easier and be a bit more accessible for shoots . when i read some of the other reviews , i could n't wait to purchase this bag . when i got it , loaded it and tried it out , i regretted the purchase immediately . first , the strap is not as padded/comfortable as is advertised and it cut into my shoulder . the gear that i had in the bag was : a nikon d3200 with a 55-200 lens attached , a 40mm standard lens , a macro lens , a collapsible hood , and a telephoto converter . this is the same gear that i generally carried in my nikon camera/gadget bag . secondly , the bag is not designed for the female form at all . both the cross-body strap and the support strap fit awkwardly around my chest , making the bag very clumsy/cumbersome to wear . i have an average build in general , so i suspect other women will have this same issue . the bag itself is not horrible . it offered plenty of space , the weather cover was a great addition , and had it not been for the design flaws mentioned , it would have been perfect . nonetheless , these design issues are a big deal . if lowepro were to correct these in their future designs , i 'd be happy to try their products a second try . as is , i returned this bag the same day i got it .
__label__positive__ i now feel so much more secure with this in my car ! ! it takes a little used to the function buttons but the definition is great in the video ! it caught some kids throwing a rock off of a bridge and ( luckily ) only hitting my side view mirror ... the cops said it was a better video than they have in their cruisers . i had actually forgot that i had it when the rock throwing happened . well , they never caught the perpetrator ... hopefully if i had been killed they would have done a more thorough investigation . i am even taking it with me while renting a car in another city ! !
__label__positive__ perfect ! ! ! ! great batteries on arrived early ! !
__label__positive__ great for small scale usage
__label__positive__ i love these things and have used nothing else for lens cleaning since i discovered them i would recommend them to anyone with a camera .
__label__negative__ unfortunately , i am returning this . i had been really excited to get this camera for a long time . when i got it i found out it will not take photos without having the lens attached to it . what ? ! seriously ? ! what is the point of a pocket camera if you have to a bulky lens attached to it to use it ? ? ? so ok that was my first disappointment . it took great photos on its trial run . i uploaded the photos to my laptop and recharged it . i went to use it the next time ... . no camera . it would not turn on . completely dead . i 'm seriously disappointed . not only does the camera not work but i was 6 days over the 30 day return deadline and neither great 8 nor amazon will stand behind this product . i was told to go to nikon for repair service . i used the camera one time .
__label__positive__ i absolutely love this case ; it fits my camera perfectly and has room for all of it 's cords and accessories !
__label__positive__ this product is awesome . it works perfectly fine . and the design gives it a better look than the regular slick one . definitely recommend ! ! !
__label__negative__ i was naturally skeptical of this little jewel . it arrived sooner than expected , and had all it 's parts , but lacked any means to clip it on clothing . the enclosed dvd was blank , so i had no drivers . i emailed the distributor repeatedly for a driver download , but got no answer . tried the camera hand-held today anyway without driver , and it worked quite well . no way was it 1080p , but good enough . got good sharp images with available light indoors which downloaded easily without the driver . after recharging , i intended to try the ir function tonight , but it was not to be . damn thing went dead , dead , dead . i guess it only had a useful life of about 40 seconds . for what i paid for this pos , i wo n't lose any sleep , but do n't , do n't , do n't buy it .
__label__positive__ the oly pro lens are great .
__label__negative__ returned , missing many pieces ! very disappointed .
__label__positive__ nice strap . well worth the price .
__label__positive__ i bought this item for a huge family trip to costa rica this summer. < br / > it was delivered just a few days before my trip which allowed me to test it out and practice with it. < br / > < br / > ends results : pictures come out great when there is good light . this is meant for outdoors , indoor pictures are ok and show some grain. < br / > < br / > all the pics we took turned out amazing
__label__positive__ works great . however it does not support a 64gb card like the newer camera . somewhat annoying .
__label__negative__ smaller than advertised : (
__label__positive__ i love it :3
__label__positive__ great deal and smooth transaction
__label__positive__ nice bag
__label__positive__ i expected the film to come in a big box but oh well .
__label__negative__ makes photo blurry
__label__positive__ 9 year old grandson loves it
__label__positive__ as advertised .
__label__positive__ good so far . just got the lens , looks great and i have compared to my previous macro canon 100mm macro .
__label__negative__ it 's doa . i tried three different sets of batteries , all of which worked in my other flash , and when holding down the start button , all i got it to do was flicker . i tried the pilot button to see if it was just the screen , but now . i 'm so annoyed right now . i was looking forward to this , as i work a lot in macro , but highly disappointed that it 's not even flickering . i think i 'll try another brand . other than it not working , the construction seems tenuous .
__label__positive__ i was a little dubious about the tripod when it first arrived , as the mount you attache to hold a smart phone seemed sort of loose , but it 's held up my galaxy s3 inside of a fairly bulky case just fine . the grippy legs also worked way better than i thought they would , easily wrapped around the door nob and the handle on my fridge i tested it on . it did n't fall off , even when i opened and closed the doors , but i 'm still not convinced you 'd want to use it on a bike or anything . for stationary uses , though , this thing is well worth the price .
__label__neutral__ this transaction itself was very smooth and easy. < br / > however , i wish i could say the same thing for the product itself . on only the second time using it , the middle neck of the tripod has been jammed all the way to the top and no can can seem to unloosen it . i had secured it to take some night shots and when done , i want unable to unscrew the locking device . quite annoyed , since the tripod now does n't fit into a suitcase or the original bag .
__label__positive__ why did they make the iso button the same as the reduce-size-of-preview button ? that has to be the most awkward placement ever . the deeper grip stresses my wrist faster than the grip on my d700 . overall , i wish i could have this camera 's specs with my d700 's body , but nikon does n't currently have a ff camera that could give me all of the specs i wanted with a comfortable body layout . so while i am overall happy with this camera , in many ways i feel like i 'm settling .
__label__positive__ for the money , not a bad buy .
__label__positive__ got away from kit lenses and glad i did , i have alot more keepers now
__label__positive__ works great .
__label__positive__ i purchased this monopod to use for wedding videography , and it works perfectly for run-and-gun , moving around discreetly while keeping a stabilized shot . i can even adjust the height in about 2 seconds . you can basically move this monopod in any which direction to create an interesting shot . the bag is very helpful . like somebody else said , the feet do n't lock upright , but i can deal with that . so far i 've only used this for one wedding , but i like using it way better than using a glidecam . it can stand up on its own with my canon dslr without touching it , however i would n't risk leaving it by itself around other people . overall this is an amazing monopod for the price .
__label__positive__ it is perfect for an amateur who wants to learn photography . for the price it is worth it..
__label__positive__ actually really surprised by how well the images looks . yes prime lens suppose to work better than zoom normally anyway , but i get a couple canon zoom lens , totally surprise this lens looks so much nicer than my other lens and canon kit lens . also let my coworker who only shot canon l lens to try this out , he was amazed how well this little lens does ! yes , i would totally recommend this , and would buy this again if ever need to ! ca n't beat the price , but the image quality alone is worth the purchase . great job yongnuo !
__label__positive__ great thank you
__label__positive__ very nice item , exactly what i expected to receive .
__label__positive__ very glad i made this purchase .
__label__positive__ great value fast shipping
__label__positive__ very cute film ! ! i 'm definitely looking forward to using it as it is definitely one of those & # 34 ; here & # 34 ; moments for your fujifilm . i will treasure it and it came very fast and securely packaged ! would order again !
__label__positive__ great piece of equipment . nothing i would change . if you tighten it down you can move around pretty freely without it go pro moving around . obviously sprinting and jumping result in a & # 34 ; wobbly & # 34 ; video . i use this for camping , fishing , canoeing , and having a hands free mount at an outdoor party or get together .
__label__positive__ super fast charger and two batteries for less than the price of the batteries . amazing .
__label__positive__ good back up flash
__label__positive__ a bit too long when you try to reach the display with your finger , but i do like hoodman products. < br / > i use it on the sony ax100
__label__positive__ i ca n't fault the product , it is as described -- - but i seldom us it . too lazy i guess .
__label__neutral__ a+ as far as delivery and packaging . my rating pertains to the product itself . unfortunately it does n't come with a 'road map ' for utilizing all the pieces . i bought this for my son two months before his birthday , had i not exceeded the 30 day return timeframe , i would have returned it . it does , however , come with a really nice case that you can use to house the camera and the things you will realistically use .
__label__positive__ very nice lens for the money .
__label__positive__ when j bought this i was kinda gambling because i wasnt unsure it would fit my gopro monopod since its not the same brand as this but sure enought it did i jus had to snap it into place and it git so im sure its a universal fit excellent product really convenient
__label__positive__ pix too low
__label__positive__ great space for camera and side pockets for batteries and usb cable .
__label__positive__ seems to work fine
__label__neutral__ definitely protects my rx100 , but adds a lot of bulk & inconvenience. < br / > my main issue is the brass knob that attaches the bottom : 1 ) it makes the camera sit off-level when placed upright , 2 ) the threads are rough and can difficult to remove , and 3 ) you must remove the bottom to part of the case to replace the battery/sd card . for the price , sony should have found an alternative to the brass turn knob . : ) < br / > the two-part design is nice as i can flip open one catch and the top of the camera and lens are ready to go . the thickness of the leather ( & strap ) made nfc difficult when transferring photos to a nexus 6 ( note : nexus 6 is also in a case , so the issue is probably the combination of the two additional thicknesses ) .
__label__positive__ i am obsessed ! ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ this was a gift . it was as described and arrived as scheduled .
__label__negative__ not happy with built in flash . background on indoor shots are dark .
__label__positive__ i bought this for hiking because my dslr is to big and heavy . it has some really cool features like an app to remotely control the phone with a smart phone , geo tagging photos but the best part is the incredible optical zoom ! this camera takes phenomenal pictures even at long range . it can be charged with just a usb cable which allows me to charge it with a battery pack or solar panel while in the backcountry . the photo menus are much better and easier to use than a dslr but takes comparable pictures .
__label__positive__ adds lots of flexibility to any photo shoot
__label__positive__ great case and the cut outs were perfect inside . the case has held up and would buy again if needed !
__label__negative__ ( warning do not buy ! ) the item i received has stripped thumb screws . ( the item appeared to be used and had brass dust from the thumb screws all over it . ) i do n't leave many reviews but this product is such a piece of junk i had to vent my anger . this is poor quality control straight from china ! i wish i could give it zero stars but i ca n't and i am out of close to 25 bucks . it is sad to say most items come from china nowadays and many of them are just plain and simple junk .
__label__positive__ they work fine . not much can be said about manual extension tubes .
__label__positive__ more than i expected for the money . great deal and more gadgets than i could ever use .
__label__positive__ i love that it makes the grip more like my e-m1 . and the added benefit of having the tripod plate automatically on it saves me searching for a plate . the side plate blocks access to the opening for the remote cable release . it can be put on in the opposite direction , but then it can not be carried around with it on . but if were going to do only tripod work , it would work .
__label__positive__ smokin great lens . great contrast and bokeh for about 600 less than brand .
__label__positive__ a good tripod for the price .
__label__positive__ the camera is great for video but not for pics . also the zoom while recording its not good but i really love its quality while recording .
__label__positive__ highly recommended for a canon 7d mark ii with a canon ef 24-105 mm f/4l is usm lens !
__label__positive__ great product works just as described your camera has no possibility of falling out of this
__label__positive__ these camera 's are awesome ! ca n't tell that they 're fake ! !
__label__positive__ product was just as discribed
__label__positive__ really handy l plate . hinge is n't obtrusive and it the screw tightens firm so it is n't moving . allows a solid tether connection for a safety and still allows a quick latch plate to be used without issue . great little adaptor - its basic but does its job well so that 's about all you can ask really. < br / > < br / > product provided for review - its just my opinion
__label__positive__ as advertised
__label__positive__ very fast shipping . battery is excellent quality . thank you !
__label__positive__ great little battery . i use it as a backup for an external monitor i use when i film . this battery seriously runs for a little over 3hrs . i was expecting it to last 1hr tops , but it by far exceeded my expectations . the charger is a little flimsy feeling , but it works ! if i ever need another battery i 'll certainly come here again !
__label__positive__ another quality op/tech usa product ! perfect sized strap for my new fuji xt1 .
__label__positive__ love love love ! ! !
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ excellent camera for the price . i have 16 of them over two homes
__label__positive__ arrived safely . worked great for my trip to the zoo !
__label__positive__ so great , purchased this for a 10th birthday . it was a huge hit !
__label__positive__ this flash is great .
__label__positive__ got to have one .
__label__positive__ is heavily zoomed , or my old camera had a wider range of sight , but it was plug and play replacement for a spoiled camera and all has been well ... video quality is as expected for the price range
__label__positive__ kenneth was very helpful in helping me set up my cameras for wireless viewing . he was quick , accurate and very knowledgeable . if you 're looking for a home camera that does it all , foscam is the one for you !
__label__positive__ good product .
__label__positive__ great imitation ☺ note : you turn light off and on ... .by twisting it back and fourth ...
__label__positive__ the screw is a little long . did not fit my application . quality is better than expected . have to return however .
__label__positive__ easy to install and nicely built .
__label__positive__ on my initial order there was a decent sized gouge right dead center of the filter . shot off an email to polar pro and received a reply within a few hours . jeff was extremely professional and asked for my address to send me a replacement without any second thought . i received a flawless lens just a few days later . outstanding customer service from polar pro ! our trip is in september so ill update then as to the products benefits. < br / > < br / > thanks jeff and polar pro
__label__negative__ this is a scam . if you want to buy this overpriced & brick monolight and think it can do wireless ttl , think again . this profoto b1 is just like the phottix indra500 that are advertised simply can not do wireless radio ttl out of the box . these two are just like all other monolights except they use one overpriced battery . and no one will carry just one battery while doing field assignments . to do wireless radio ttl , you must donate around $ 500.00 usd to the company for their radio transmitter . so you will need a transmitter for monolight ( canon ) . another transmitter for monolight ( nikon ) plus a monolight for nikon . two transmitters ( canon or nikon ) will not work on one profoto b1 ( made for canon or nikon ) . this junk is lighter than this junk , phottix indra500 . the first , has battery attached to the side , making it very heavy to carry and hold with large softbox or if the photographer tells the walking tripod to hold up high . the second overpriced is tethered to a large brick of battery , but the head is a little lighter than the first . profoto b1 & profoto b2 use profoto air remote ttl ( transmitter ) that has no af assist beam ( big mistakes ) . joe mcnally and moose peterson were fooled . because their cameras are having a hard time doing af in low lighting . you would think these two pros would know better . how dumb is that , not having atg 's af ( auto focus ) assist beam on the transmitter ? do you think you can make a profit by selling a camera that can not do af and has no meter . or selling overpriced brick monolight that can only burst around 500 pops ? many events & wedding photographers shoot beyond 1000+ . atg suggests to buy from friend cheetahlight cl-360p combo deal [ ... ] -includes atg/cheetahlight 's battery pack ( which is better & cost less than quantum turbo 3 battery pack set ) -the battery is compatible with c/n/s flashes by just buying a cable , which can not be done on profoto & phottix 's batteries . -includes atg/cheetahlight 's wireless radio transmitter that is better than using pocket wizard plus iii . -you can buy two set and the power will be much more than profoto b1 . and use them as wireless adjustable group a & group b lighting . so if you got the nikon version of profoto b1 with the air remote ttln ( transmitter for nikon ) . and your friend or partner is using canon , then you have to buy another complete set which it does n't include the radio transmitter . atg & edward tang , cheetahlight are from usa . so support usa . they are only available in usa . atg is by referral only .
__label__positive__ was a gift , she uses this all the time , but was disappointed that not instructions came with this . had to go on line and figure out where to locate them and get them/
__label__neutral__ ok for the $ 20 . it is not a professional made stick . felt plastic like and cheap . locking nuts were not sufficient and i just did not like the cheap feel of the stick . the stick to get is made by the same company but is called a goscope boost & boost plus . when i ordered those i got what i was after , a professional gopro stick that will take some abuse .
__label__negative__ i think that i have only reviewed one other product over the two decades that i have been ordering from amazon but felt it prudent based on the current 4.5 star rating on this tripod. < br / > < br / > have you ever pulled something out of a box & # 34 ; wanting & # 34 ; to love it ? that was me with this item ; after all , i spent way too many hours reading reviews before i made the purchase and of course wanted to my decision to be right. < br / > < br / > while setting it up i quickly noticed that some of the leg clamps snapped very aggressively while others just kind of just pressed slowly in place with out any sort of snap whatsoever . when standing the word & # 34 ; sturdy & # 34 ; that was used in some of the other reviews most definitely was n't on my mind . the entire unit was loose , wobbly , and felt cheap in general. < br / > < br / > in my dismay i thought & # 34 ; well , you get what you pay for and i guess that i can live with it & # 34 ; . again , trying to validate my decision to purchase this unit. < br / > < br / > sadly , the good news is that when i was breaking it back down one of the pins holding the legs together fell out so i packed it back up and placed my return request with amazon . it will get picked up to go back for a refund on monday. < br / > < br / > over the years i have just grabbed whatever tripod was on sale at target or kmart when i needed one without any sort of research and i can say that all of the tripods that i grabbed blindly were much better than this one . i am going to order the 67 & # 34 ; vivitar tripod and will post my opinion on that next week. < br / > < br / > note that this products is actually made by digital visions and averages $ 17 - $ 18 at places like walmart , sears , and ebay . at $ 17 i think that you are actually getting what you pay for ! < br / > < br / > hopefully this review will help someone else in light of the other reviews that appear to be suspicious at the very least !
__label__positive__ this bag is awesome . i 've been using it to carry my pentax k-50 around on my motorcycle . seems to be sturdy and well-built , the padding gives me confidence that it will keep my camera insulated from all the vibrations on my bike , and i like the various storage pockets . this does n't feel like a cheap , & # 34 ; going to break in 2 weeks & # 34 ; kind of product when you pick it up . would definitely recommend to anyone .
__label__positive__ these are very nice filters for the price . they have really helped with my photography , especially with sunsets
__label__negative__ my camera arrived without a charger also can not connect mount 1 to mount 2 ratings need some answers please or i will return it i have tried every way to put the . together to make the stand
__label__positive__ worked like a charm
__label__positive__ : )
__label__positive__ i mainly use this for matching imac screens with normal monitors , works like a charm !
__label__positive__ excellent camera ... .i am very happy with it .
__label__positive__ these are a nice solid pair of binoculars , they are constructed with quality . i returned them looking for a more powerful vision range pair. < br / > i bought a stronger pair from a different seller and they were terrible . i wish i would have kept these instead ! < br / > but with the return shipping fee i paid i could n't bring myself to order them over again .
__label__positive__ it works really great on iphone and android . i bought this one for a gift but i tried it first to be sure it works pretty well and my friend loves it !
__label__neutral__ i purchased this for my cannon sx150 power shot camera . the good news is that yes indeed it will fit , however it is a very snug fit . in fact you can only put the camera inside the case if goes in with the lens up.try putting the lens end first and you will not get the case closed . it is not very easy to get the camera inside and the case zipped up ! my next one will be a tad larger. < br / > < br / > short version , fits just barely and allows for battery storage in the outside pocket .
__label__negative__ going beyond all the negative reviews have already pointed all ( all true ) , i 've personally experienced two additional issues : 1 ) . the software on the included cd is corrupt , i can not install the program on my pc . therefore , i 'm only left to use the p2p app on my iphone to configure this unit . 2 ) . the camera can not locate my local wifi ; it & # 34 ; selectively & # 34 ; shows some of the wifi 's available ( from a list of all possible wifi 's that may be shown on a pc or iphone ) . however , it just wo n't show my local wifi . i tried this both at home and office , no cigar . if i ca n't get the camera to recognize and log onto my local wifi , i will not be able to view this camera remotely . hence , i 'm stuck with connecting to the camera every time i want to view the image - this means i can not connect to my local wifi and have to be physically present next to my camera , either case will render this camera useless to me. < br / > < br / > for those who complain about the quality of the user 's manual in english , do n't feel too bad . the chinese version is equally suck . the root of the problem is not the manual but a poorly designed product . if you were to go to the manufacturer 's web site , you wo n't even see this product listed as one of its offerings . this speaks volume about the quality of this product. < br / > < br / > stay away . i bought this unit because it 's relatively cheaper given its supposedly claimed functions/features . bought it at $ 56.59 , it 's now at $ 69.99 . it 's not worth it at any price . i wanted to return this unit but too late ; i would if i could .
__label__neutral__ works but it came in a case far to large for a 58mm filter . also the case had a large crack going down the front of it .
__label__positive__ fast shipping , product as described .
__label__positive__ i have a standard 18-55mm lens . this adapter works best at 55mm . i only use this adapter when taking fun family pictures . i do noticed that the edges of the pictures are not crisp when taking photos between 18 - 35mm . the background is not fully black ; i can see rings . overall , i am happy with this product . i am just a hobbyist .
__label__negative__ useless
__label__neutral__ the long part of the star gets into picture frame needs to be bent out a little
__label__positive__ good product so far , but the instructions are inadequate . i installed mine to be on all the time in my rv so i could use it like a rear view mirror . the gridlines do not activate unless the & # 34 ; trigger & # 34 ; for that video source is energized . i tied this to the reverse lighting circuit and now it turns on the grids when i am backing up . the picture quality is pretty good for the price .
__label__positive__ excelent price，unbeatable combo .
__label__positive__ fast delivery , bargain prices . good quality batteries .
__label__neutral__ fits my lens but the adhesive to secure the cap to the string and band did not last more than the second day of our trip . it does come with extra string and the cap has a hole to tie it to the band , but it is not readily attached . a good price for 4 caps though .
__label__positive__ these are visitor brand batteries at a bargain price as far as i can see . basically getting three for the cost of one fuji battery . came well < br / > packaged and fully charged . superfast service . highly reccomended
__label__positive__ excellent dvr 's , excellent upgrade over the dx8000 and dx8100 dvr 's . cheap upgrades - give me a shout : $ 100/tb , dvr expert .
__label__positive__ bought this one on a whim . i 've never had a quadrotor before and thought i 'd try it for $ 50 . i must say i 'm very impressed . having only flown rc helicopters before , i had no trouble picking up this machine and flying it right away . the battery connector can be hard to get in and out because it is small , but a pair of needle nose pliers makes it easy . also , the camera angle is tilted down pretty far , i may try to modify it . it 's not unusable but i 'd like it to look more & # 34 ; out & # 34 ; than & # 34 ; down. & # 34 ; overall , great buy .
__label__negative__ for what you pay , you get . the threads inside the gopro tripod mount were not deep enough to get a secure fit to the tripod . also , the tripod mount struggle to fit securely with the thumb screw used to mount gopro to tripod connection . if you are looking for a small durable tripod this is n't for you . but if you are in a fix and need something for a one-time event this might work .
__label__positive__ perfect , great built , great price .
__label__positive__ nikon 's highest resolution super telephoto .
__label__negative__ i like the indoor one , but the outdoor camera is a disappointment . it does n't record based on motion properly . 99 % it does n't record anything , even though i check the setting again and again . the new software is not as good as the old one , either . update : within six month , it does not provide image anymore . power is not the problem . very very dissatisfied .
__label__positive__ good price and product .
__label__positive__ great product and great service from company .
__label__positive__ my old canon powershot finally bit the dust after 15 years . this elph 170 is lighter , thinner and faster . great camera .
__label__negative__ the charger that is provided with the batteries is not for those batteries . the batteries are a perfect fit for the camera but the charger will not work for the batteries . luckily i checked before we left on our month long trip and realised why the batteries would n't charge . i had an extra charger laying around and compared it with this product and figured out that the charging notches are not in the right place for these batteries. < br / > so , two stars for the product overall .
__label__positive__ the product arrived on time . the product is working as advertised .
__label__positive__ really nice boom stand , as other reviewers said , this is a really nice stable and sold product . im really happy with it .
__label__positive__ perfect bag for a smallish dslr and a couple of lenses with compartments for extra battery and lens cleaning supplies . padded insert bag protects the camera or extra lenses nicely .
__label__positive__ i purchased this on black friday as a gift for myself . the quality of this little guy is incredible . i took it to europe and it got beat up in my little backpack that i carried around everywhere . still picture after picture and time after time , this had a good range on my d3300 and provided great photos on my trip . i would whole heartedly recommend this item to anyone who is starting off photography and its looking for an all purpose lens .
__label__positive__ my first fuji , this is a wonderful camera , capable of taking professional photographs . it has features making it a good fit for advanced shooters and beginners alike . both will appreciate the beautiful , best-in-class design , the accurate and bright screen and viewfinder , the smartphone integration , and the on-lens aperture adjustments and dedicated setting dials . the camera is truly fun to use and changing settings is a better experience than in any other camera system i 've used ( along with most of the fujifilm x-series ) . < br / > < br / > for anyone around , this camera is a complete steal compared to similar competitors at $ 799 for the body alone. < br / > < br / > for advanced shooters , it has 7 customizable buttons , very clean images at higher iso ( i.e it 's good on low light ) , strong lens selection , and multiple focus peaking and other manual focus assists. < br / > < br / > but those newer to dslr style shooting will appreciate the comparatively straightforward dial layout , compact size - and especially the dedicated switch which kicks your camera into automatic mode so you do n't miss a good shot while you 're still learning how to use the camera in manual or other advanced shooting modes . the latter shows fuji 's true intent for this camera as an accessible professional tool for all levels of shooter . the jpeg quality is generally accepted as the best in any brand , meaning new photographers can still get great images without shooting in the confusing , large file raw format ( though raw is available for those who like to heavily edit their images ) . < br / > < br / > i love this camera and i 've made better images on it than on any other crop sensor camera i 've used . even in low light , it suffers relatively little compared to full frame cameras . i personally prefer its images to the crop sensor canon and nikon dslrs i 've used . actually , it 's not a contest in most ways. < br / > < br / > the exception is for those who shoot sports or wildlife , who might find the xt-10 's burst mode to be a little slow and cut out soon . it 's comparable to a canon rebel series camera in burst capabilities . it also is n't weather sealed , which is too bad . and for those with big hands ( like me ) , it might seem a little small - though it 's not uncomfortable to use and a grip can be purchased. < br / > < br / > but for anyone who does n't need super-speed burst mode or weather sealing , the $ 500 you save on the xt-10 vs it 's bigger brother is much better put toward lenses . it has the exact same sensor , focus abilities and a similar screen and viewfinder . it will give you exactly the same images. < br / > < br / > but theres a catch with this bundle : it 's still a better deal than buying the lenses separately . but it could be significantly cheaper were the redundant , lower quality 16-50mm lens omitted . it 's entirely unnecessary with the fantastic included 18-55 lens , which is faster , better built , and produces better images . the only advantage of the 16-50mm is a lower weight . those few ounces are n't worth the added cost.nd cut out soon . it 's comparable to a canon rebel series camera in burst capabilities . it also is n't weather sealed , which is too bad . and for those with big hands ( like me ) , it might seem a little small - though it 's not uncomfortable to use and a grip can be purchased. < br / > < br / > but for anyone who does n't need super-speed burst mode or weather sealing , the $ 500 you save on the xt-10 vs it 's bigger brother is much better put toward lenses . it has the exact same sensor , focus abilities and a similar screen and viewfinder . it will give you exactly the same images. < br / > < br / > but theres a catch with this bundle : it 's still a better deal than buying the lenses separately . but it could be significantly cheaper were the redundant , lower quality 16-50mm lens omitted . it 's entirely unnecessary with the fantastic included 18-55 lens , which is faster , better built , and produces better images . the only advantage of the 16-50mm is a lower weight . those few ounces are n't worth the added cost .
__label__positive__ this remote is more than perfect . not just for its price , but it 's of a high quality and works just fine out of the box . very easy to use .
__label__positive__ bought these for backup for my wife 's canon camera . they worked great . held charge as long as the original .
__label__positive__ i bought this lens to use in a slide duplication project -- i needed something with a longer focal length than my 12-40 mm . putting it with the slide duplicator that i had failed to focus properly , but i remedied that with a simple +1 close-up lens in between the duplicator and the lens . works great . my 3000+ slide project became manageable again. < br / > < br / > then i began using it for walks along the river in the evening when the deer come out , and it has worked great . an excellent lens , and even better when you can get it at a good price .
__label__neutral__ bad quality control because there is a variation of batteries and microphones . records low quality video which is stretched to & # 34 ; 480p & # 34 ; . all are stamped 2013/12/13 on the circuit board and date stamp can not be removed which is annoying because it is huge on the lower right hand corner . does not come with a sd card , you must have a micro sd card to put in in . version # 25 on http : //www.chucklohr.com/808/c25/
__label__positive__ fair price for quality of the product
__label__positive__ we hope they will ward off thieves !
__label__positive__ this works really well. < br / > first the cons - no off or on button , no way of knowing how much battery remain. < br / > < br / > now the pros - all plastic but well made , the compartment to hold the battery is also well made , the battery door is not flimsy , my flash is recycling much faster . i am totally satisfied with the performance of this battery pack . i am going to try it out at an event soon and will adjust my rating if it flounders . if it works great at a live event , then i will buy another .
__label__positive__ i wanted a smaller pair of binoculars ( 8x32 ) to keep in my vehicle and decided to take a chance on these . i was very surprised with the crystal clear , sharp , bright image obtained with these celestron 71330 nature dx 8x32 binoculars ! i have several larger much more expensive binoculars , in 8x42 and 10x42 , with ed glass . if there is a difference in the image quality , i ca n't see it . these are perfect for what i wanted and i have been using these quite a bit for birdwatching too as they are so light and handy with plenty of fov . i am extremely pleased with this purchase . these are just plain outstanding , especially when you consider that they are only about 1/4 the price i paid for my binoculars with ed glass !
__label__positive__ this is my first underwater camera . we were diving on vacation and another diver had a gopro . we loved what we saw . i put the gopro in my wishlist and planned on buying it before our next winter getaway . some how i stumbled upon the blusmart . it appeared to be similar except $ 300 less . since the ups or usps delivery guys stop in from of my house almost everyday and check to see if we have a package that day or not , i felt comfortable & # 34 ; trying & # 34 ; this camera from amazon . when i opened it i was surprised at all the mounts , straps and even a second battery . i was disappointed when there was no memory card . i logged in an ordered 2 cards and still could n't wait , so i went to best buy and had a card in hand in a few mins. < br / > i charged the batteries and went out to play with the camera . learning how to use it with only a 1 page manual surprised me ... the 1 page manual and about 3 minutes was all i needed to be able to take pictures and videos . another couple of minutes to figure out how to open / close the waterproof case and i was taking pictures and videos in and underwater in the pool. < br / > now for the minute of truth ... what do the pictures and videos look like . i put the memory card into my pc and copied them to my hard drive . the video is 1080 , so it look great on my 40 & # 34 ; high def tv that i use as a monitor for the pc . the pictures are pretty much the same as you would get on any average point an shoot camera costing 2 to 3 times as much as this blusmart. < br / > i have only used it for a few days so far , but already plan on buying 1 for each of my kids as stocking stuffers for christmas and 1 of the 3 people i 've shown it to so far is buying 1 . when you consider the price , the size , the quality of pictures and video , if it only lasted for a week long vacation it would be a good investment . i have taken a few hours of video and over 300 pictures , most of them in the water and it works fine so far . i got 250 picts and about 20 mins of video while swimming in thebay with the camera on most of the time . while playing back the videos on the camera the battery ran out . since it comes with a spare , this is plenty of battery and storage for me . this will be in my pocket or hand till it breaks , which hopefully wo n't be anytime soon .
__label__positive__ these are great . they let me use less expensive 3rd party batteries..
__label__positive__ do n't buy the cheap mounts . buy the gopro original . it 's worth the additional cost . i rode over 2300 miles on my harley with this attached to the front fairing and it worked great .
__label__positive__ so easy to use , love that it uses aaa batteries now if i forget my charger no problem . i have only taken a few photo 's , really nice .
__label__positive__ worked out great .
__label__positive__ super
__label__positive__ worked
__label__negative__ item was broke out of the box .
__label__negative__ will no longer hold good charge after 4 or 5 charges .
__label__positive__ nice camera . i 'm still learning how to use it .
__label__positive__ excellent screen protector , i only gave it 4 stars because to me it seems that the images on my screen seem just a tad darker than before but besides that i have to say it is a great screen protector that is made of a hard glass surface ; this product gives you the confidence that your screen is well protected and best of all , no more protector fall offs. < br / > before this i was using one of those plastic clip-on screen protector that was always falling off the camera , the last time it fell i accidentally stepped on it and cracked it thus i started to search for a replacement. < br / > this product is really good , it installed rather easily and once on you ca n't even tell that it 's there , there are no bubbles at all . one word of caution , as with all screen protectors you need to make sure that the screen is clean and totally dust free before installing the protector . also , the adhesive on this thing is very sticky so make sure that you align it correctly before you proceed to final placement . heck it i was able to do it , anyone can..not really good at installing these thing but the vello was my first perfect installation . one final suggestion , when you install the protector do it at a place that is not prone to having dust particles in the air , i did mine in one of the meeting rooms at my company. < br / > i 'm planning on buying another one for my d3100 !
__label__positive__ holds my two camera bodies , 3 lenses ( one being a telephoto zoom ) , flash , batteries and more ... . neatly and safely
__label__positive__ these are great . i have two of them and they work perfectly .
__label__negative__ it 's a good idea ... until your batteries do n't work . i ordered mine on 12/25/2014 and within the first month , one battery no longer worked . now , neither of them work . now i have to order more .
__label__positive__ it was delivered quickly , it fit exactly what i wanted and for a finale they included a great ( gratis ) microfiber cloth . they even followed up with an e-mail requesting feedback .
__label__positive__ i have had problems with 2 oem batteries causing the camera to shut down after only a few minutes of operation during warm weather . a third oem battery and this one works fine . i use the camera on my motorcycle at the track . this is a high vibration environment . we run 15-20 minute sessions every hour ( 7 per day ) and i have n't had this one die on me yet ( 1-2 bars left at the end of the day ) .
__label__negative__ this system is only good for daytime use . in daylight the cameras are triggered by small birds flying by . at night the range of the motion detectors drops to nothing despite the fact that the infrared emitters do a fair job of night time illumination . i can drive a car in front of the camera at night and not trigger the motion sensor . that is a disappointment . daylight images are very good , but i really bought this system for tracking what happens in my driveway at night. < br / > < br / > installation was very easy . the camera mounting brackets are fragile . be careful with over tightening the adjustment bolt . i 've had no issues with the range of the wireless . the cameras synced to the viewer immediately and have stayed connected for several weeks. < br / > < br / > others have mentioned the lack of a date stamp on the videos . that makes this system useless for event documentation . there is no way to know the exact time the video was recorded. < br / > < br / > in summary , the system fails on one of the mission critical tasks i needed .
__label__neutral__ not quite there yet . could use an alert if tempature drops below a certain number or above a certain number in case heat broke and pipes would freeze while away . or in case a/c broke . also 2 way audio would be nice , if people think it 's creepy then they would not use it . give them the option . motion sensitivity would be nice , to eliminate all the alerts i recieve for my dog . i have piper too , they both have plus and minuses . face recognition would eliminate some of the dog issues . i like canary 's ios app better than piper . piper has battery back which is nice too . a power outage alert would be nice , so you 're alerted to this issue instead of having to always check the device . additionally a feature that would auto arm the device from anytime you set , eg , 12am-6am , everyday would nice so that you would n't have to remember to arm it every time you went to bed
__label__negative__ i received the quad you sent me today and immediately i could tell something was wrong as i could hear loose stuff rattling in the box . i opened the box & removed the box the quad was in and i could tell it was ` nt new and upon opening i found the screwdriver , card reader , and one of the blade protectors and also the charger loose in the box . upon examining the quad itself there were screws missing and no screws in the blade protectors . i went ahead and charged the battery and low & behold the quad had one motor unresponsive and it finally went to work , however the quad would not lift itself off the table.you have sent me a used , defective unit .
__label__positive__ gets my white balance in check when i film . very useful if you make videos or if you shoot portraits in uncontrolled lighting environments .
__label__positive__ i wish it had a locking foot but i 'm thinking that a tabletop tripod may end up being a better fit in the long run . the assumption of not providing one is that it does have a 1/4 inch tripod mount , but if you wanted to use the flash cold shoe on a surface it 's not secure . as far as operational use , it 's doing great so far . high speed sync , second curtain , groups all functioning correctly .
__label__positive__ so far , so good . cameras seem to be of quality build , programming was simple and joining them to blue iris was n't any great chore . picture quality is good , if not the best i have seen . given that they are traffic control cameras for the church , that is fine . price was good , and the features we needed was there . time will tell if they hold up well or not .
__label__positive__ works perfectly !
__label__positive__ does what it does , cheap plastic but it 's cheap cost too , works well .
__label__positive__ great package and value . i love my camera
__label__negative__ it functions properly and can endure some rain . but for climbers or wilderness photographers , it is a bit too delicate . i have had 2 of these in the past year , and both have got caught on something rock/tree while climbing , and the end that attaches to the camera frays and breaks , and is no longer usable . so if you have the money and do climbing and outdoor photography , i would recommend something more durable if available. < br / > < br / > i do believe this is still a better option , in terms of durability than the cheaper $ 3/ $ 5 options .
__label__negative__ the charger seems to work but one of the batteries will not hold a charge any more . this happened after 2 months . i 'd spend your money on the samsung battery as a spare and not worry about a charger . you can charge the batteries using an external pack anyway .
__label__positive__ best value hands down . you ca n't get this amount of cleaning items for 9.99 anywhere else . the blower is not giotto but it 's a good addition to your camera bag . same thing to say about the lenspen knockoff . other than that you get a huge magicfiber ( plus 2 of the regular size ) , a 2 oz cleaning solution spray and some tissues i rather use for reading glasses and monitor screens as they 're kind of rough for photo items .
__label__positive__ works great !
__label__neutral__ does anyone know how does the audio works . when i speak on my iphone the sound does n't come out of the speaker on the camera . thanks
__label__positive__ one side of my big lights do n't work . other than that the product is a great buy .
__label__positive__ the accessories are quality accessories ! they all work quite well , they are a little harder to screw in because they are n't made my go pro , but you ca n't go wrong because of the low price .
__label__positive__ nice but i was surprised the bubble is not illuminated as in my cheaper s8 benro .
__label__positive__ this thing is amazing for the price . works very well but i do have one problem with it . it blocks out your flash
__label__positive__ this is all you need if like me you managed to snap off one of the shock absorbing struts at its mounting point . however , and this is a big however , you must be an expert at assembly/disassemble and have all the right tools to replace this component of the bebop drone . search & # 34 ; how to disassemble parrot bebop drone to see tutorials on how to accomplish this . i am in the middle of dis-assembly and this is clearly not for the faint of heart . you will remove dozens of small screws , you will have to pull wires free of their assembly position where they were glued in place . you will have to use a knife to cut lose the front housing which is glued to the main body . this is a major assembly , reassembly and i 'm guessing most purchasers will not get the drone back together in working order .
__label__positive__ nice camera . takes great photos and also nice videos . used it on a trip to ireland and lots of people were envious of me when i started taking videos of people dancing in an irish pub .
__label__positive__ worked as expected ! only draw back : no instructions for cage assembly !
__label__positive__ best deal for film !
__label__negative__ you get what you pay for i guess . easy to set up . what really sucks is i used it only once and one of the leg latches to clamp the extended leg broke . it 's useless now . i like to do night photography but since the latch is busted , it moves causing the images to come out poorly . i would n't recommend buying this
__label__negative__ bad design . due to the nature of how you & # 34 ; close & # 34 ; the case or secure your camera , the on/off button is directly underneath the close strap . every time i put my fujifilm xp80 in the case , the close/secure strap turned my camera on and wore the battery down . due to the way the case is made , you can only put the camera in the case one way , it will not fit if you put the camera in & # 34 ; upside down & # 34 ; . i feel it is a design flaw .
__label__negative__ picture quality is a poor , and the frame is cheaply made . the wall mounting slot has exposed circuit board beyond it by design . mine worked for four hours before dying . i will avoid this brand in future .
__label__positive__ fits my sony a7 perfectly !
__label__positive__ great item to allow me to see the camera lcd on a sunny day .
__label__negative__ this is not a universal ac adaptor , it does not fit into my device
__label__positive__ the frame is really cute and it will be a great bridal shower gift for my niece who loves all things disney . i knew the frame was overpriced at $ 58 but disney wedding frames are n't easy to find . however , when i looked at the packaging , there was an original price tag of $ 28 on the box . a $ 30 mark-up is pretty steep .
__label__positive__ gift for my daughter who loved it .
__label__positive__ it would be better if it had a lock in mount instead of a screw in .
__label__positive__ just as described . fast shipping . a+
__label__positive__ this is not the real sj4000 camera . if you are planning on buying the sj4000 do not buy this one . the seller of this camera is & # 34 ; dbpower , not sjcam & # 34 ; . you can see under the lense it says & # 34 ; dbpower & # 34 ; , not & # 34 ; sjcam & # 34 ;
__label__positive__ for someone like me who was experimenting with cameras and light work this is amazing ! it brightens up the area but gives a natural soft lighting . i loved what you get for the price too ! ! so affordable and i got everything ! a bag to hold it all in , lights with switches , umbrellas , stands ! ! ugh ! ! so good !
__label__positive__ perfect
__label__positive__ the best night and day
__label__negative__ i should have read the reviews . it is obviously a standard practice to ship one bad cable with one barely working . crap products from a crap company . avoid at all cost !
__label__positive__ so , i 'm done buying cameras for a while . this camera is great for travel and keeping in the bag for family outings . i owned an x100 before , and while the images were better with that camera , i missed so many shots due to the poor af speed . with this camera , i rarely miss a shot of my toddler . i do wish that the lens went to at least 24mm , but it 's not enough for me to not be totally satisfied with the camera .
__label__positive__ this pistol grip works great , i have had no problem using it , well built. < br / > yes it has some weight to it , but not an issue for my tripod. < br / > a fantastic grip , well work the money .
__label__neutral__ as a new item must not have scratches , however has them . if you see other buyers comments , you will see they have the same concern .
__label__positive__ great product as described ! ! ! awesome seller !
__label__negative__ complete junk
__label__positive__ i love this little camera . i bought it for my wife 's birthday and we both love it . it takes great pictures and has tons of features that you can mess around with . i could n't be happier with this camera . its nice and small so when we travel you can take it out anytime . the pictures are clear as any pictures i have seen . overall a wonderful camera if you are looking for something for vacations .
__label__negative__ easy setup ! works on blueirissoftware as a foscam fi86xx/98xx compatible ( not as a tenvis jpt3815w ) . < br / > vendor refused to issue $ 25 amazon card even after leaving this unbiased feedback ( requirement of their offer ) !
__label__positive__ just what i needed to attach strap to camera . sturdy without being bulky .
__label__positive__ have n't used it yet , but it appears to be well made and solid .
__label__neutral__ my order came in with a part missing and the item box damaged . i got a replacement and replacement item box was damaged again . used only an paper envelope , would n't use this buyer to give as a gift . as for the product . it 's a bit bulky to use , it does hold my cannon d70 slr ok , but i have doubts that it will hold my camera while walking for a while . it uses friction to stay onto my backpack straps only and i hope it does n't start falling down the straps . ok product and i guess its better than to use my camera straps and get my neck sweaty . so i will give it an okay rating because the connectors and the holster seems to be made out of plastic and not aluminum . i hope my camera does n't fall out and the camera mounting system does n't brake . a lot of people say it is hard to remove the camera out of the holster . to remove it all you have to do is turn the camera 90 degrees and pull it out . when the camera hangs down it 's in a locking position , so the camera comes out . i do n't understand how people could n't figure this out , even if they do n't give instructions with the item
__label__positive__ seem very durable . wish you could pick the color . i got the white ones .
__label__positive__ love my camera !
__label__positive__ i use this with yongnuo 622c and strobes . it works perfectly and is n't cumbersome like longer cables .
__label__positive__ i wanted to upgrade from my note 3 to an actual camera . i love taking photos and i love photography and as a first camera i wanted to learn on film . i am still figuring out all the settings and whatnot but i love this camera and it 's taught me so many things already !
__label__positive__ this review is for the 960h 8 channel system with 4 cameras . first off , the setup is really pretty easy , you will need to run wires and figure out best camera placement . the best advice i can give you where this is not spoke of at all is the app . for the 960h system you will need to find the & # 34 ; amcrest link app & # 34 ; . nothing else for the 960h will work properly . it took many weeks of trial and error . then i came across 1 mention of this app . it was honestly , 30 seconds after installing the app i was up and running on all my portable devices except for a windows 8 system . windows 8 does not seem to be supported . read the other reviews , you will find one underlying complaint of the 960h , and that 's the app . there are people who claim they did not have any issues , i 'm assuming they had the hd series camera system , the apps for that seem to be much more easy to find . the amcrest link app is a bit of a search , but it is on apple store and google play apps
__label__positive__ what a fantastic lens . i went from the kit 28-50 lens that came with my nikon 3200 to this and it was like going from a pinto to a ferrari ( ooph . that shows how old i am ) . < br / > < br / > it was like going from a pt-loser to a tesla . it has taken my photography - such as it is - to a whole other level . i would buy this brand over and over again. < br / > < br / > the fact that the price is a fraction of the price of comparable lenses by other brands is just icing on the cake .
__label__negative__ i 've been trying it for several days using it in my shirt 's left pocket . focusing is a problem , because you do n't see what the lens is capturing . the sound many times is not continuous .
__label__positive__ fit perfectly
__label__negative__ when used with my canon 70d camera it will not allow me to check focus by pressing the switch halfway as it is supposed to do . i used an ohmmeter to check out the switch positions and they all indicate continuity at the correct positions . therefore either the switch plug is out of tolerance or the camera jack is out of tolerance . bottom line , does n't work as advertised . not eligible for return. & # 34 ;
__label__positive__ seller was very good to work with . i was very pleased with my purchase .
__label__positive__ thank you , you do good work
__label__positive__ case # c6711112 - badge # ar004276 < br / > rep name was lovely - she was very patient and helpful . walked me through the entire set up process - it was very good customer service - extremely attentive !
__label__neutral__ once it is hooked up to the wireless it was very easy to connect . instructions for setting up the motion alarm were not clear and a loud alarm kept going off in my nursery ( i use the camera as a monitor . )
__label__positive__ sweeeet
__label__positive__ unfortunately , i 'm still trying to play with the camera . it 's very simple to use but i have not made the time to do so . the price is right . have fun with it .
__label__positive__ perfect , sturdy , fast delivery ! < br / > an amazing product , easy to use . just back from a family holiday and was great to be able to take group photos without having to ask someone else to take them .
__label__positive__ happy with the purchased on this one . used for my go pro while in the car .
__label__positive__ easy to use !
__label__neutral__ the cameras are good but they are not wireless.thats why i gave 3 starzs ! ! ! if they were wireless i would give camera system 5 starzs.the setup is very easy ...
__label__negative__ this light died in five months .
__label__positive__ get some , at these prices buy many , works well with yongnho wireless units .
__label__positive__ one of the best price/performance of the market .
__label__positive__ did not take my gopro4silver to the boat yet ! ... < br / > < br / > doctors .
__label__positive__ i upgraded from the a35 to the a7s and all my full frame lens work perfectly on the a-mount to e-mount adapter .
__label__positive__ very useful
__label__positive__ much nicer than the g1w . setup is easy and does its job well .
__label__positive__ awesome lens ! totally great from a business perspective . you have to have lots of room to get everything in view when indoors , but the bokeh is beautiful and it 's quick and sharp focus . totally love this lens !
__label__positive__ seems to be good quality , if continues to charge & power like this it will be perfect
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ took this on my cruise and used it while snorkeling . if fit my wrist perfectly and i had no issues with it . if you need something to keep your gopro securely on your wrist , i would highly recommend this .
__label__positive__ every accessory i could want ! the only minor comment is some of the nuts were not embedded in the attachments and i had to replace them before i could attach my camera .
__label__positive__ great product , fast shipping ! ! !
__label__positive__ here 's how i arrived at 5 stars : knowing ahead it 's manual only , i did n't take points off for lack of ettl functionality . it does what it 's supposed to do , and is just slightly tricky to turn on , while costing a mere fraction of my canon 580-x . the extra star is for intuitive , ease of use . head swivells great . so far , i 've gotten real good results whether using as a primary or secondary light source indoors , or for fill-in flash outdoors in daylight . the price is so reasonable , you should get 1 or 2 just as a backup in case your $ 600 strobe dies on you ( it happens ) & # 62 ;
__label__positive__ not interchange-able with gopro branded products ... did the trick for us , but know that the backs are not interchange-able as this is not a gopro product .
__label__positive__ very good pictures and video quality . price right for the product , very happy with the purchase .
__label__positive__ i have always wanted a gopro and not that i have one i love it ! a great buy !
__label__positive__ was concerned the anti-glare would make the screen hard to see or foggy . not an issue , love it so far .
__label__positive__ you get lots of pictures that you otherwise would n't have captured . this is wonderful -- no doubt about it. < br / > < br / > the downsides : you end up with a lot of pictures . hundreds of thousands . also , after 18 months of daily use , the battery life is around 8-9 hours . given that there is no on-off switch this means that i can not capture a full day of activity. < br / > < br / > in spite of these issues , i 'm buying the newer model when it comes out , but i wo n't use it in the same way ( i.e . not every day ) .
__label__negative__ dont waste your money on this mount , first the cheap screw they give you strips and you can never get it tight enough to hold the gopro in place it just flops around . this is simply a design flaw the left side is threaded for the screw and the aluminum wo n't flex against the gopro mount to hold steady . i have this 0 stars and do not recommend it .
__label__positive__ perfect for my jbl pulse and the charger .
__label__positive__ it´s a nice little device , practically plug-n´-play , if you´re doing the physical cable attachment , there´s no mistery whatsoever , plug it in your router , it comes online , download the app and you´re ready to watch and hear from anywhere . the reason i dpn´t give it 5 stars is because the motion activation is too sensitive and i keep getting flase warnings many times every day . i guess lighting changes such as when a cloud momentarily obscures the sky might be enough to trigger the sensor . i still haven´t played with the sensitivity settings so i might be able to improve on that . nice device for a reasonable price , i´m satisfied !
__label__positive__ price beat out the competition and product was as advertised .
__label__positive__ ok , there is no support as other people described . forums are good enough , to fix many issues . i did have problems with firmware , as hikvision 5.3.3v firmware did not worked . camera was basically useless after this update . i was able to recover it , going back to 5.2 with tftp . software provided at hikvision website is good enough for basic stuff . there is a version for windows and mac ; both versions are fully functional and free . the iphone app that i downloaded was also from hikvision , ivms-4500 ; note this app supports english language ... just download it and your phone will change language to english by default . the power adapter that used was an old linksys router power supply ( output 12vdc 1000m amp ) . it is a poe camera , thus i switch to poe power injection that someone posted here and it worked too without problems . why 4starts ; well lack of support could be an issue .
__label__positive__ generally works fine . the only glitch is the peak hold feature does n't seem to lock in on the max reading . if the max reading is only there for a split second it does n't hold and the max reading on the display will be short of the absolute peak .
__label__positive__ very good！
__label__positive__ i love this if you plan on scuba diving or snorkeling this band wont disappoint you it has little pillows to let it float even in the ocean in case you lose it wonderful little gadget for my under water diving camera case
__label__negative__ i am a mama of 4 who loves photography and looking to get better . i was looking for a good beginner flash just to get me comfortable with using one so i purchased this one last christmas 2014 . this past week july 2015 after using it several times i went to take 9 month photos of my son it had completly stoped working . i was devastated not even a full year and the product does n't work . save your money buy the next step up on a flash kit
__label__positive__ great item
__label__positive__ the greatest thing to come around since sliced bread if you do green screen photography
__label__negative__ for the price it simply is not worth buying better to spend more and get more usable features . my 2-cents .
__label__positive__ product is as described . nice to have extra 's for when we lose another lens cap .
__label__positive__ um ... $ 45 for a tripod and ball head that work very well ... h**l yes ! after tony northrup recommended this tripod , i gave it a try ; and my oh my am i happy . initially i had a broken leg lock , but less than 30 hours after my first email to dolica i had a replacement . currently no problems , and a steal of a deal . i have traveled to alaska and cancun ( back to back ) with this tripod and have only had great pictures . i really like the weight hook , which i find unnecessary for stability , as it keeps my gear off the beach . the pan is a little too quick , and will have consistency issues when applying tension ; but this entire tripod costs less than half my nice ball head does. < br / > < br / > is this tripod perfect ? no . but ! ! ! this tripod is an amazing value , and will be 90 % as good as the gear that costs 10 times more . i 'm serious . i use an oben cc2361l tripod with be-117t ball head . together , they cost $ 450 , but i will take my dolica tripod on hikes . the dolica does almost everything , and almost as well as my oben stuff . hard to justify a more expensive tripod over the gx600b200 .
__label__positive__ efficient for a low price
__label__positive__ this was a purchase for myself and i have found it as advertised and a good purchase . the seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with .
__label__positive__ i use on top of a monopod
__label__neutral__ very short range ! !
__label__positive__ perfect for what i need it .
__label__positive__ looks nice quality and fits in flash sync tight unlike my other cheaper hot shoe .
__label__neutral__ does n't fit on my camera so i ca n't really use it but is a good strap
__label__positive__ luv this gadget ! does exactly it says it does ! kinda pricey so shop amazon for the best lowest price
__label__neutral__ the quality is ok..a little cheap material. < br / > the most important thing is the case is a little big from that kind of camera and there are n't good security on that ... so the only good thing i can do is only to keep inside the home.no very safe to carry out .
__label__negative__ battery has very poor performance . it only functions a very short time before the battery is dead . i would like to return these two items .
__label__positive__ i just received my phantom today . i did get it a week ahead of the proposed delivery time . i am so looking forward to getting everything charged up and trying it out . i love the bundled items. < br / > < br / > thank you
__label__positive__ simple and reliable , perfect for studio work and for portable lighting , but only in manual .
__label__negative__ i bought this thinking i would use it quite a bit . when i got it , and even after using it a few times , it just feels way too stiff for me . not comfortable , and i could n't imagine having that strap on my shoulder all day , especially if i was wearing a tank top . i need to find something a little better . also the front pocket is so small . i tried fitting my rodelink transmitter and receiver in there and had to battle to get it zipped .
__label__positive__ great dog , bought two . try to get two more .
__label__negative__ the charger included batteries that work well when charged . on the other hand , the charger does not work at all . the charger will not charge batteries of any size and in any of the slots . i do not recommend purchasing this item .
__label__positive__ good camera . lots of features . a little flimsy .
__label__positive__ case is convenient for carrying
__label__positive__ this is as small case . just got the wonderful canon sx700hs and it just fits in the case . also it has a nice size front pocket to store memory card , battery and microfiber cloth . good quality construction and small enough to carry in a small bag or purse .
__label__negative__ my girlfriend got this for me as a gift and i was excited ! from what her and i had read this would seamless allow you to transfer photos from the camera to a smart phone . sadly , the required app needed to do this is terrible . i have a galaxy and an iphone , it works better with the galaxy but still is n't reliable enough to even bother with. < br / > < br / > if you decide to purchase this expect to spend a great deal of time trying to use it. < br / > < br / > do not recommend !
__label__positive__ works great . i use it as an access point . setup is very easy
__label__positive__ works as advertised . a nice add on to a great camera .
__label__negative__ i have had some success with other neewer products , however , this one is not good . compared them to tiffen filters and hands down these were awful . the color of photos were crazy . these are very cheap and yes price is cheap but junk . plan to spend the extra $ 50 cause it is worth it ,
__label__positive__ worked as well as i had hoped . easy to operate and use . only drawback is the small viewing screen making some images hard to view and actually determine orientation . i also found that some of my parents slides from 1958 were slightly larger than all the others making them extremely difficult to feed through the convertor . this is not the fault of the manufacturer though just a heads up to any possible purchaser . i would purchase another if needed but would look at getting the television cord so i could use the larger screen of a television as a viewer instead of the built in 2 & # 34 ; unit .
__label__positive__ great item . love using it when we are surfing and also when kayaking and hiking
__label__positive__ perfect beautiful set ! just what i wanted ! i just wish they came with guide for lesser experienced people , but absolutely perfect !
__label__positive__ this good price
__label__positive__ fast delivery , excellent brand
__label__positive__ great value !
__label__negative__ it does n't fit most of the baby monitors .
__label__positive__ love using this for my dslr in the kayak ! i holds my camera nicely with extra lenses and some supplies . the shoulder strap is a little awkward , but at least it has it .
__label__positive__ great alternative to the comparable nikon lens for a fraction of the cost . it 's a bit noisy , but that does n't bother me .
__label__positive__ great addition to my lighting bag .
__label__positive__ excellent product ! great deal .
__label__positive__ fantastic binoculars ! the quality of the image they provide is outstanding . you can pay more than twice as much for the equivalent nikon binoculars , and the nikons would probably be better , but they would only be 5 or 10 % better , not twice as good. < br / > the 8x42 are perfect for me for birding , sight seeing , sporting events and stuff like that . they are a good balance of magnification , wide field of view , and brightness ( exit pupil ) . the higher magnification 10x42 would also be good for these things , but you give up some field of view with the higher magnification . the extra field of view is helpful for following birds that tend to move around . it is easier to find the birds , and keep them in view . higher magnification also means more image shake , the 8 power is easier to hold still than 10 power . the larger exit pupil makes viewing easier , even in bright daylight , because you can see the full image circle , even if your eyes are n't perfectly lined up behind the eye peices. < br / > i where eye glasses and these binoculars work great with them , i have no trouble at all seeing the full image circle . i just fully retract the eye cups with a twist , and i 'm good to go.the eye cups make viewing with out my glasses very comfortable , i just have to adjust the diopter. < br / > they are a medium to full sized binocular , but i find them light enough to cary around my neck all day . lighter than my 7x50s , but not quite as bright at dusk or for looking at the night sky. < br / > they are nitrogen purged and waterproof , so they wo n't fog up , on the inside , and you can use them in the rain with no worries . if they get dunked in the river when you are canoeing , they should be fine. < br / > all in all , i think that for the money they are excellent quality , and being nitrogen purged at this price makes them even a better buy .
__label__positive__ good lens for the money
__label__positive__ so far so good . no complains , works as advertised . very good replacement < br / > november 2015 update : < br / > < br / > used two of these batteries for a couple weddings with lots of shots , and for a long trekking trip . batteries look very reliable have n't had any sudden energy drop problems so far . looks like they last as long as the nikon ones , i have seen no difference and i 'm very pleased that i got two batteries which work like the oem ones , for the price of one .
__label__neutral__ very nice lense
__label__positive__ a great alternative to more expensive selfie sticks . worked great in the ocean , lakes and in pools .
__label__positive__ this battery works just like an original panasonic battery in my fz70 . it charges in the charger that came with the camera and has given me no problems . great price .
__label__positive__ absolutely love having extra batteries and a way to charge more than one at a time . the recording time on these are just as long , if not longer , than the original battery that comes with the gopro .
__label__positive__ great camera for backpacking . lightweight and small version of a dslr in a mirrorless camera . great for creating artistic shots .
__label__negative__ i bought this lens instead of the 70-200mm because of the major price difference , but i should have just waited to buy the other lens . images are not sharp at all . the bokeh is nice for most shots , but that does n't matter when your image is n't sharp . the lens is okay from 70-100mm , after that the focus and sharpness are both lacking majorly . save and buy the 70-200mm like i am now doing ...
__label__positive__ genial
__label__positive__ good product worked as stated
__label__positive__ installed in my basement ! does not come with screws ! luckily i had the perfect screws . took me 3 minutes to install . awesome alarm for the price and piece of mind !
__label__positive__ great lens . love the internal zoom . lens quality is great .
__label__positive__ well made and easy to use product , well worth the money .
__label__positive__ so far it works like a charm . it does what i need it to do and more . its only been a few days and i would recommend this product .
__label__positive__ love it
__label__positive__ sharp and quiet stm wide angle lens with reasonable price from focus camera. < br / > with stm lens your video will be noise free instead when recording using usm lens. < br / > recommended buy .
__label__positive__ works great and has expandability
__label__positive__ great fit , easy to use and feel it really protects my camera . i 'm completely satisfied .
__label__positive__ arrived fast and works perfectly !
__label__neutral__ works well . they are not built to last forever but what is . they will do well if you take care of them .
__label__positive__ was looking for a replacement for a smaller much older digital frame . this is very nice . pictures are clear and set up was n't difficult . really like the wifi syncing with dropbox and the ability to email pictures to it . liked it enough to get a second one for the office . now there are both sync 'd to the same dropbox folder and update automatically.very happy with this .
__label__positive__ inexpensive umbrella with good diffusion .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ great tripod that is easy to use and small enough to carry just about anywhere . works great with my nikon d5300 .
__label__negative__ unfortunately , i bought this and it came a month before i could get my go pro . when i finally opened it to install it the joint where the handle joins the mount is cracked . not able to return it due to time ( my fault ) but ... still it is broken in the box . it was well packed so i do n't think it was a shipping problem either . makes me think that the product really is fragile .
__label__positive__ all went well with the purchase
__label__positive__ easy to hook up with no problems at all . love this cam ! !
__label__positive__ works well with my swan security system . there are a few lines in the screen otherwise would be a 5star
__label__positive__ so far so good . they did well over a 5 hour shoot with about 700 photos . if these hold up over time , they will be a much cheaper alternative to the nikon .
__label__positive__ i own a canon 600 ex rt . this is exactly like the canon . according to my flash meter readings , at full power it is about a 1/2 stop less powerful . i own a 25 year old can not flash from my film days that still works ( less powerful , no modern features ) . so if the yongnuo flash will hold up like my canon equipment , then it is well worth the money .
__label__positive__ i am very happy with the batteries and charger . they worked flawlessly for me . i am glad i got them !
__label__positive__ for the price , this is a great little system . i really like that the monitor is battery powered , and easy to move around .
__label__neutral__ i did a lot of research on compact cameras and picked this one because of the 21x zoom , and the built in wifi . i was looking for something better than my phone 's camera , but easier to carry around than my dslr . but , this camera freezes up when i want to preview the pictures i 've taken & it seems to have a pretty slow shutter speed when you 're using the zoom . i 'm using it , but i 'm not impressed . my iphone takes just as good pictures , it just does n't have the zoom feature . if i had this to do over , i would n't have selected this camera .
__label__positive__ just as described , delivered quickly .
__label__negative__ battery life does n't seem to have alot of juice . the stock battery i received with my phantom 2 seems to last me longer ! i dont think its what its advertised to be regarding longer battery life !
__label__positive__ smallrig rocks . we were able to built our rig as we wanted . without purchasing complete kits . your parts are grade & # 34 ; a & # 34 ; and rock solid . saved us over $ 500.00 on our project and we could n't be happier . our station will get many usage of your product . thanks smallrig . p. s. you customer service was equally excellent
__label__positive__ these were a great investment for my camera ! i 'm having a lot of fun learning how to use these to maximize their effects with my camera . they came with a convenient storage pouch that fits great in my camera bag .
__label__positive__ i love this product , its a good quality product for a low price . one of my favorite pieces of gear
__label__positive__ perfect
__label__positive__ product met my expectations - worked great .
__label__positive__ was very pleased with the product , once i figured out how to open it ! allows me to take close-up photos of objects on the same surface the tripod is resting on . light weight , and compact , for easy traveling .
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ perfect fit
__label__positive__ i like it , works well , my only concern is that it actually feels a little loose on the m4/3 mount . there is a little play when it 's supposed to be locked in . does n't seem to affect the performance at all , i just would feel better if everything locked in tighter . especially since it 's so freaking expensive .
__label__neutral__ item as described and the quality is good , i just thought it would be alittle longer in length .
__label__positive__ shipped fast . like crazy fast . everything came as told . some of the extras are okay , but you cant beat the discount on the nikon 32000 itself . great camera . the memory cards are great , and the bag is pretty good for a starter bag . the flash is not very good , doesnt lock in very easily , and the tripod is a little light ( aluminum based i think , but stll does what it needs to do ) .
__label__positive__ awesome assortment of tec stuff for the one who is starting !
__label__positive__ driving , especially parking can be really hard if you ’ re a beginner driver . there are a lot of pedestrians and other obstacles that might get in your way . with this awesome camera that i got as a sample , i can easily see what ’ s about to come and i park safely and cause no damage at all .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ excellent selection of mounts for a very reasonable price .
__label__negative__ i 'm returning/exchanging this one . does n't charge from an outlet , only from cigarette lighter in the car .
__label__positive__ 500 slides in 4 hours and works as advertised , now its a paper weight . i will sell it for 80 bucks !
__label__positive__ this adapter is a great buy . i allowed me to really explore my camera and what it can do . before this purchase i had to rush and get pictures taken before the batteries ran down . now i can take my time .
__label__positive__ these things are legit , will hold upward to two solid lbs a float . i strapped one of these to my galaxy note 4 , and my go pro and it kept both devices a float no problem . this is a must have for anyone bringing a device into the water that they do not want to lose .
__label__negative__ they did not work at all
__label__positive__ great buy for the price . based on the reviews i knew how it would come packaged so i was n't worried about that . it did n't arrive broken , i fastened on the bulbs and was ready to go . however , even though i knew it would n't have a diffuser i 'm just really sad it does n't have one because it would really help other than that it 's perfect ! and it came a day early so you know i was excited about that !
__label__positive__ decent quality pictures . fun to have . i recently got an iphone and disappointed that it does n't work with it . but still works with bf phone .
__label__positive__ i received this item in order to provide an unbiased and honest review. < br / > < br / > i 'm a very advanced , professional filmmaker and this is an interesting device . i tried it with my panasonic g7 ( not for filmmaking but it 's my portable mirrorless ) and it works very well . pairing this with an iphone 6+ also works as intended . but i ca n't get it to work with my blackmagic cinema or pocket though that 's understandable . if i do , i 'll update this review . i 'm not docking a star since they 're strictly filmmaking cameras as opposed to a modern dslr with added functions. < br / > < br / > the packaging is great , very professional and clean . the device itself is as small as others have stated , a plus ! < br / > < br / > the main benefit is really for dslr users if yours does not have remote trigger capabilities as opposed to smartphones , even though it 's labled as as a & # 34 ; selfied disc & # 34 ; .
__label__positive__ this is my first one and i love it , light weight and functional
__label__positive__ what a deal , brand new condition , much better than most other bags i 've owned , would highly recommend
__label__positive__ works great ! have had no issues , so far , with false alarms or no detection . i find it has a little better range than 30ft . that is reduced on rainy days . like all the different tones to choose from . set up was easy . volume on receiver is loud , if that is what you need . i would definitely recommend this to friends . best $ 160 i ever spent !
__label__positive__ very cool product . i use these for portrait photography and for music videos and they 're a great addition to a cheapskate 's camera arsenal . taking off one star because the switch on one of the lights is really finicky . it seems like a loose wire because i need to adjust the cord 's positioning to keep it on . you 're paying for the nice softboxes and nice bulbs . the lamp piece and the stands are pretty cheaply made , but get the job done .
__label__positive__ flawless .
__label__positive__ works fine . took off a point for lack of clear instructions . i had to find video instructions from orion on youtube . i was able to figure it out from that . well made .
__label__positive__ nice case - covers lower body and easy to take on and off - looks good . has little door on side to open for access to usb . one drawback which others have mentioned is to change battery or get access to sd card you must remove the case .
__label__positive__ i have enjoyed using these . they are not expensive so i did n't expect a-one quality , but they are better than i expected . the only complaint is they can be hard to separate when using them in combinations . they have allowed me to make some very neat photos of insects etc .
__label__positive__ love it so usedfull
__label__positive__ i bought this calibrator in order to take a photo editing class . ( damien symonds rocks -- check him out ) . i thought my brand new imac was perfectly calibrated , but then i bought the colormunki and saw just how cold and bright my screen was . this has helped me as a photographer to be more confident in the product i 'm putting out and that my prints will match my lab 's printers. < br / > < br / > the device and software was easy to install . the only hiccup i ran into was that my mac would n't recognize it until i plugged in the calibrator , shut down my computer , and restart it . then , i can choose a display type . i 've had it take a couple shut downs . i 'm not docking it a star because once it 's recognized , it does a great job of doing what it does best !
__label__positive__ great product . images are high quality . ca n't complain .
__label__positive__ works great !
__label__positive__ cheaply built but works well , even i could build a better unit , and i will .
__label__negative__ so prior to purchasing anything , i do a lot of research ... almost to the point of obsession . i watch youtube videos , read product specs and reviews , create spreadsheets , etc. < br / > < br / > after realizing that i needed to add more movement in my videos , i decided on getting a jib for use as a stabilizer for my gh3 , gh4 , and gopros . i looked at ebay , amazon , alibaba , craigslist , and about everywhere else i could find references to jibs or cranes. < br / > < br / > after about a month , i decided on this jib . the reviews looked good , it looked a lot more sturdy than the similar jibs in the same price range , and came with a case. < br / > < br / > when i received the jib , i looked at connecting it to a tripod i had and was incredibly frustrated as the screw provided would not screw into the bowl mount of the jib . this may have been an isolated incident but the unit i received was defective . the screw thread in the bowl mount was incorrectly tapped . it was between a 11mm and 7/16 thread . having the thread off , i was unable to use the provided screw and unable to adapt it . i took it to my local bolt and screw company , they measured it , and confirmed that there was no solution that they could offer. < br / > < br / > that being said , if i had been able to mount it correctly , i 'm sure i would have enjoyed it . it came with a case that held it and the accessories . the case seemed a little cheap and it felt like it 's only a matter of time before the zipper fails. < br / > < br / > i ended up returning it and purchasing a used indy jib [ [ asin : b00g49tbwe indy jib 4 ' camera crane for dslr 's and video cameras ] ] instead for $ 129 on amazon. < br / > < br / > hope this helps save you from a frustrating situation .
__label__positive__ these floats are wonderful . i was n't sure 1 would support my compact binoculars but they floated them without any problem . great for my camera and gps also .
__label__negative__ i should have read the reviews ! batteries went dead , removed , only to find out pictures delete when battery goes dead or you take batteries out !
__label__positive__ product fullfiled the expectations
__label__positive__ wow ! ! ! ... you ca n't go wrong with this purchase ! ! ! outstanding quality , and a great price compared to alternatives . you really do n't need the more expensive gopro/pole branded models when you can have camkix ! you 'll get more bang for your buck here . if you 're looking for a bobber handle for your gopro to use on vacation , whether it 's hawaii , the caribbean , or in my case , the galapagos islands , this is the best you can buy ! extremely happy with this purchase , ... thank you camkix : p
__label__positive__ this camera does a great job . after initial setup , i had to change routers and their customer service walked me through the setup revisions .
__label__positive__ ok
__label__positive__ rather than buying a new one i bought two cameras that were used . i bought this one and a canon si20 . i really like this camera for the run of the mill family shots that seem to comprise most of my photography . we us and slr for the more professional landscape stuff . this camera is light . it almost feels toy like in construction . the battery is special . something i am not fond of considering the canon uses regular aa batteries , but this battery seems to last a long time and it charges quickly on the portable charger.30 minutes and you are done . the buttons on this camera are smooth which makes them unobtrusive and hard to find . but they work and there are not too many . the canon and this one have more capability than i will ever use . i like the on line manual . if it were paper it would be too big to carry . the leica lens on this camera seems to be ok . there is some cropping and crinkling on the picture edges that is not noticeable on the canon . but the difference is pretty small and with the mundane subject matter i use this for , ( like birthdays , around the house stuff , maybe a picture of a cancelled check , etc . the distortion around the picture 's edge is not even noticeable.all in all this is the better of the two i bought . the canon is heavier , delays pictures much longer , and seems a bit more user unfriendly than this one . i 'd buy this for a kid 's present or a gift for an older person who just wants a point and shoot with a little pizzazz but it is not for a serious photographer .
__label__positive__ very nice item . however , it pushes the legs out just slightly and made the phantom not fit in the case without forcing it in . the case has the cutouts for everything to sit in securely . i put the edges on the grinding wheel to shorten it a little bit and it works fine now .
__label__positive__ excellent product
__label__positive__ my daughter had enjoyed it so much . she was completely satisfied and extatic with the case .
__label__negative__ broken in less than two uses ? yup . what a piece of rubbish ! it has been used for two vacations and now the charge port is broken . i suspect these are made to be disposable . our camera had less than 200 pictures on it so that 's about $ 1.50 per picture . my sister has the same camera and the screen died within the first year . olympus ... get your act together .
__label__positive__ got them in a timely manner and just what i wanted and needed . seller does a great job .
__label__negative__ these cameras are very buggy as they stop working all the time and have to unplug them the ptz does n't as promised
__label__positive__ item delivered on time and as described .
__label__positive__ works just as it should ! no more fiddling with where to put the camera lens cover .
__label__positive__ great for spare batteries ... wish it would hold the charge a bit longer .
__label__positive__ works for my needs !
__label__positive__ i 've had terrific results with this lens - i use it mostly for landscape photography , on a dx sensor nikon . exposure is perfect , and i pretty much leave it set to infinite focus .
__label__positive__ for the price this ca n't be beat ! the grip fit my e-m5 mark ii like a glove allowing for easy battery , sd slot and swivel lcd access . also the tripod slot is just below the tripod slot of the camera , so your camera will still be centered if on a tripod . makes my e-m5 mark ii look really good while giving a better grip . skip the expensive oem options and buy this !
__label__negative__ i was so excited to get this after looking at the reviews . i thought maybe the negative reviews were just picky shoppers . i got it , rushed to put it on my camera , and became instantly depressed . so blurry , so foggy , such a waste of money . please save your money while it 's not too late .
__label__negative__ the usb cable that came with the camera does not fit the slot in the camera . so i tried to read the images directly from the sd card with a card reader ( the way i used to download images with my old canon ) . it downloaded about 15 images then erased the memory card ! i lost everything . what good is a camera that you ca n't get the pictures out of ?
__label__positive__ i was impressed with the packaging , very fancy . the quality of the material is phenomenal . for my nikon d80 i was using the default strap that came with it and it was uncomfortable , but this one is very comfortable and fashionable . i highly recommend it . i received this product for a discount or for free in exchange of an honest and unbiased review .
__label__positive__ just fine .
__label__positive__ all the stuff in this kit came in handy on a recent snorkeling trip .
__label__positive__ from what i can tell , it is a real fuji battery and powers the camera for the same length of time . we got this as a spare for when we are in the field for an extended period . works fine .
__label__positive__ my favorite 35mm lens on a full frame sensor.. ! i use it on my a7r. < br / > there is something special about the rendering of image that is hard to describe . colors and contrast you get from this lens are second to none . the out-of-focus area - bokeh - is gorgeous. < br / > the focusing ring is buttery-smooth . focusing manually is fun with this lens . it has some heft to it - solidly built , not heavy , but it feels substantial. < br / > < br / > many have described sony distagon 35 f/1.4 za as the best 35mm lens available for any system . i should know ; i owned that lens until i got this one . i ’ d say , this voigtlander is as good as that distagon ! the only thing you lose is the auto focus . but it ’ s much smaller , lighter , and it costs $ 600 less than the distagon. < br / > so , if you are comfortable with manual focus , this is the legacy glass to get for your sony a7-series bodies . just get it and experience the pure joy of photography .
__label__positive__ great product and price . will buy from seller again .
__label__positive__ excellent product .
__label__neutral__ i had a couple of parts broken . a lense was chipped and broken apart and the mini tripod broke but otherwise everything else works just fine . the tripod might be my fault though i do n't know .
__label__neutral__ heavy and not as much room as expected buy ok !
__label__positive__ they are all useful product with reasonable price .
__label__positive__ seem to work fine .
__label__positive__ this makes time lapse photography so easy . i bought it for my canon rebel t5 so i could do astrophotography as well as zoom photography without creating motion . it works perfectly . regular mode allows me to release the shutter using the trigger according to the shutter speed settings on my camera . if i switch camera to bulb mode , holding down the trigger allows me to count up to whatever length exposure i want . ( the camera screen beeps each second and counts up so i know when to let my finger off the button ) .
__label__negative__ these camera floats started out to be just fine , but once they are wet they no longer float . i tested the buoyancy and thought great it works only to lose my gopro to the bottom of the river once the & # 34 ; float & # 34 ; wrist strap was in the water for an hour or so . : (
__label__positive__ this is a great rolling camera case . holds everything i need for photographing weddings .
__label__positive__ there was a bit of user error on this as it takes some getting used to and some wd40 or gun oil . once i did that , the system is n't bad at all . you do have to have the legs attached to the slider or the inside rails will protrude out . the markings along the track are great for reference . i just used this with a dual fluid head setup and was able to get some very usable slides . granted this is n't a name brand slider with great bearings , but it does do it for the frugal guys . i can see myself upgrading but this is better than my failed diy build and looks better for clients .
__label__neutral__ it does what it says ... just remember it does not take a picture for you , it is just an extension pole .
__label__neutral__ the color of the bag is much lighter than the picture . the material looks a bit cheap . it was poorly stitched together on the inside of the cover . it was also delivered to me a week late. < br / > < br / > the only reason i did n't give it a lower rating was because i only paid about $ 17 for it , excluding shipping . though it would be nice , i did n't really expect top quality when purchasing ; however , i will be getting another bag from elsewhere soon .
__label__neutral__ its a basic bag , replaced it shortly after i got it with a pelican case , this is okay for a cheap camera when you need to save space .
__label__positive__ im very unhappy with these batteries i purchase them months a go for backup never charging them until i was ready for my vacation and they fail . they did not hold the charge . i charge them the night before and then when to use them two dudes .
__label__negative__ did n't work with my nikon : - (
__label__positive__ great
__label__negative__ the bottom , where the weights are , just slide off . almost dropped my camera . terrible , do not buy this !
__label__positive__ the perfect fit for my camera . keeps my expensive lens free from dust and helps to protect them from scratches .
__label__negative__ the description is misleading . it did not work on my camera
__label__positive__ the camera lens case worked out and fit perfectly . quality looked good and put together well . the purple band and purple fur interior helps to differentiate between cases . very satisfied
__label__negative__ i ordered the black backdrop but received the white . it did come in one day though .
__label__positive__ this is a much better deal than i can get in town . thanks
__label__neutral__ i have used this a lot for taking close up pictures of insects and plants . it definitely works as a good diffuser , not only for an attached flash but of course it works for the smaller on-camera flash as well . some commenter had complained that it rotates around the camera lens . of course it would do that , just look at it ! you simply grip the bottom with a free finger with the hand that is supporting the lens . after a lot of use over several weeks , the threads holding the elastic band around the lens hole is starting to separate from the rest of the diffuser . i understand that is b/c it is cheaply constructed , but that cheap construction is why it is , well , cheap to buy . i simply sewed it back and i am good to go . the springy frame is also starting to lose its uniform oval shape , but i just work with it .
__label__negative__ then vivitar auto focus teleconverter lens would not operate on auto focus . i had to manually focus to obtain an image . i 'm very displeased with this purchase and when i return home later this week i will be requesting another one that works .
__label__positive__ i 've had this about a year now . did a lot of research and is worked out very well . the menu system is a bit clunky , but what camera 's is n't ? ! wish they would start using focus groups to build decent user interfaces . i own a panasonic plasma tv , and both have been terrific .
__label__negative__ rated these 2 stars because although these are really cool . they are not hd . they are n't worth this much money if they are claiming to be full 1080p hd because they are n't high quality .
__label__positive__ these fit decently , but you can tell that they are not perfect . do n't quite & # 34 ; click & # 34 ; on the way they should and when the two wo n't screw together ( bad sign ) .
__label__positive__ over priced but it is better than other frames . great viewing choices and uploading options .
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__negative__ liked it at first ... .but now it wont work right ... i want to send it back
__label__positive__ thus was a gift for husband and he is 110 % in live with thus product . i would definitely buy from this seller again . fast delivery , great quality of product !
__label__positive__ these are great when first starting out . after awhile they become cumbersome and a headache to put back in the pelican case the unit stores in . when you get good at flying them , they are not needed .
__label__negative__ battery just stop working after a month
__label__negative__ worked at first but was ultra sensitive and took snapshots just when lights were turned off . the all the sudden stopped working for video or snapshots . i 've reset memory card numerous times . reinstalled whole camera ... nothing
__label__positive__ i 'm just writing this review because of all the mixed reviews on this camera . i searched reviews for a week on cameras- i 'm very picky when it comes to an expensive electronic purchase . well i bought a sonyw830 and returned it the same day- all the reviews made it seem like it was better than this camera so i tried it out & it had a good & # 34 ; shot & # 34 ; every 1 in 10 i took- literally . i have 4 boys so i needed something a little more reliable than that & something that 's going to catch action shots so i am glad i returned it and decided to get this one ! i bought the camera yesterday & took a few shots at home of my boys jumping around and obviously some came out blurry ( it 's a point & shoot not a dslr ) but majority of them got the shot with little to no blur . my real test was at the beach today ! it does have a little problem with focusing on the right object but you just press the camera shot button down half way and it refocuses and usually gets what you wanted , then press the button all the way down and bam , perfect picture ! ( it 's a quicker process than what it seems ) . the zooms ' photos are also amazing ! i 'm really impressed with this camera and glad i spent the little extra money on it . i do feel like 200 $ is a bit much , maybe around 160 $ would 've been better but then again maybe that 's because i 'm cheap : -p - i never do reviews but just wanted to post one just in case someone else was stuck in between reviews on cameras like i was ! : )
__label__positive__ seems sturdy and well made . feels very comfortable on my back . plenty of cubbyholes for things you need to bring along . the only negatives are that you have to remove the props when using this case and there are no areas within or outside the case for carrying other stuff .
__label__negative__ did not fit together with go pro brand equipment . had to file it out to get the pieces to fit .
__label__positive__ good cheap diffuser for a portable cheap canon flash .
__label__positive__ love it ! everything i need fits in neat and comfortably .
__label__negative__ had to return this thing because the volume rocker was broken twice . you may get lucky and get a good one but i wouldnt trust it .
__label__negative__ could not even get this item to turn on ... ... returning .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ work and fit just as well as the original .
__label__negative__ followed all instructions yet the camera started having issues after only being in the water for less than an hour ( less than 4 ft deep ) . has n't worked right since , though i 'll say that the pictures it took prior to that turned out beautifully .
__label__negative__ one of the most overpriced items that fuji sells . it does the job , however , it adds a significant amount weight which defeats the whole concept behind the x100 series camera . it does make the camera front heavy and not very well balance to the point where you must kind of hold the bottom of the camera while you walk and the strap is around your neck . i used it once or twice and it has been shelved ever since . i give it two stars because the picture quality is not compromised , and the filter size is the same as the 23mm x100 lens .
__label__positive__ how ! what a huge improvement over their old outside camera ! ! ! massive improvement on both color and clarity ! ! ! ! to the trash with the old xxx04 . i hope foscam uses this same technology in more of their cameras . i will have to upgrade !
__label__positive__ excellent tripod for the price . if you are on a budget go with this video tripod .
__label__positive__ very nice , works great , quality product .
__label__positive__ this flash is fantastic . it really will flash 210 feet . finally you 'll see at least some of the flashes at the ball games actually reach the players. < br / > < br / > i 've never had a flash that has recycled to take the next shot so quickly . it is almost as fast as the camera. < br / > < br / > the powered telescoping is an absolute must . i often take a picture , then a second zoomed in . old flashes , i would never remember to extend the flash manually and then back again when i was done . so i would most often get over or under exposed shots . once i corrected , it is usually to late to take the shot again. < br / > < br / > the only problem i see , so far , is that the spot beam flash appears to reach the distant subjects but there may still not be enough definition for the camera ( k3ii ) to auto focus properly . i saw this when trying to take a picture from far away of a bank of trees and shrubbery in almost no light . i do n't think any photo system in this price range will do this well .
__label__positive__ it works . great price . very happy .
__label__positive__ it is good but every 3 min i rather keep steady videos without stop when i want to turn off
__label__positive__ this bag fits everything i need it to fit . very durable !
__label__positive__ fits perfect
__label__positive__ just as described
__label__positive__ so happy with my new hard to find battery for my nikon cool pix camera !
__label__negative__ returned did not work
__label__positive__ still using it 3 years later
__label__positive__ i am very pleased with my purchase and the price was reasonable !
__label__positive__ they work perfectly with my home studio .
__label__negative__ i received a used filter with finger prints on it and multiple chips on the glass , they were needle size tips chips but none the less , i was under the impression that i was getting a new filter . very disappointed , going to stick to buy my filter from b & h photo
__label__negative__ i bought this camera for vacation , i went threw 3 sets of batteries within 75 pics . the camera will not power off unless the batteries are removed . not the best picture quality either . keep shopping .
__label__positive__ i bought this lens recently and this is my first third party lens that i 've owned for my nikon body . images were great and right out of the box no af issues on my glass . everything was superb , great as everyone reviewed until i fixed my hood . the hood marker on my piece was not at the center as shown in stock photos . it is kind of skewed to the left above af switch . so when i fix my hood the petals are n't aligned at the right place causing images to show heavy vignetting on two corners . after fighting with the hood for 15mins i went online and no one had this issue yet . also noticed the stock photo comparison and my glass mark was completely off centered . see image of the lens on the mark where it is , it is at where switch is instead of the meter area on stock photos . now i 've returned this to adorama and waiting for my replacement to start shooting with this beast . one star drop for qc . i 'm a big fan of anything made in japan but in this case the quality control at sigma not following six sigma is clear , pun intended . will update review on how the next one comes , hope it has no af issue as this one . update 8/24 : now i got the replacement lens which does not have any issues and focusing has no problem at all . this one is a keeper , i own nikon 24mm f1.4g and this 35mm is a true walk around lens especially night time street shooting . i did some vertical pano with it and which had minimal distortion . better than the 24mm for vertical pano . ca n't wait to use it when christmas lights are out on the streets . updare 9/5/2015 : now i get to use this lens and was blown away how awesome this is for landscape and wide angle portraits . my previous go to lens was 24mm f1.4 nikon but sigma did it with half the price and quality of nikon . color reproduction , micro contrasts are awesome . i loved sunstars in 24mm f1.4 and this sigma does it well too , see image sample . bokeh is pleasing too , see the image sample on it at f1.8
__label__positive__ it 's just what i needed .
__label__positive__ brand new . came with everything necessary , but was not the color orange . the camera came in camo , but other than that , great .
__label__positive__ nicely built .
__label__positive__ this is a review based on only three days of usage. < br / > < br / > first thing i noticed was that the camera was very well packaged with an air-cell sleeve and a generous size box . then i noticed the mount which requires three screws to mount ( typical ) and has thumbscrew mount adjusters . this is a huge plus . my original q-see cams came with a ridiculous proprietary mount that needed both a phillips driver and a funky-sized hex wrench to adjust the aim . what a pain that was . even the lorex cams have a couple of phillips screws that require loosening so you can ratchet past detentes and then tighten down again. < br / > < br / > ok , screwed the base in place , screwed the camera onto the mount , turned on my remote viewer and tilted and rotated to my needs . first thing i noticed was that this camera has a much longer focal length than any of my other cameras . that means there is a much smaller field of view at the same arbitrary distance ( more focal zoom ) compared to the lorex and q-see cams . the next thing i noticed was the clarity of the image . this camera replaced a 700tvl lorex unit that came with another dvr . there was nothing wrong with that cam but i was curious what the extra rez would accomplish on my basic d1 system . it does a lot , a whole lot . for under $ 30 i am way impressed. < br / > < br / > check out the screenshots . these were taken from the exact same mounting point with no color correction other than what was already in the system . you 'll want to pay particular attention to the fence that is almost 1000 feet away . in the 700tvl it looks like a white blur while the 1200tvl shows the individual stringers . then look at the bicycle behind the tree . at 1200tvl you can see spokes . sure , some of this is due to the longer focal length but not all of it. < br / > < br / > now we 'll see if it holds up over time . i 'll get back to you .
__label__positive__ helps with multiple pictures , batteries last longer .
__label__positive__ perfect size to fit in a bag , and i thought the quality was better than i expected .
__label__positive__ does a good job of lighting up the front door for the security cameras . cheap but works ... i 'm happy .
__label__positive__ sweet stuff for a good price
__label__positive__ could n't be happier . just returned from a trip and it was waiting in my box . i 'll be leaving tomorrow for a convention in las vegas tomorrow and will put it to a real test . in the little bit of time i had today to play with it , i am impressed . seems to be a slight problem if you are n't careful in mode 3 with the gimbal hitting the extreme range of rotation ; i suspect it is more to do with me then the gimbal . i really like how small it is and the two sets of batteries is a nice addition .
__label__positive__ it works , though i had better luck getting rid of color casts with the spyder express 2 ( until i lost it , and upgraded my monitor ) . also , the wire is a bit short near the weighted area , so during calibration you basically have to hold it on the recommended spot , as it ca n't fit on it 's own with the wire situation .
__label__positive__ i love my gopro but did n't love that i did n't know what my video looked like until was able to upload it onto the computer . the bacpac is the perfect solution . my only complaint is that it sucks up the battery . now i have to charge the gopro everything i use it . however , it 's worth the trade off for knowing i 'm getting the video i want .
__label__positive__ i love it ! ! great fit..i will give 5 stars
__label__neutral__ excellent quality , but a much darker color than pictured . main strap leather is nearly black .
__label__positive__ terrific and sturdy
__label__positive__ fits the camera it was recommended for fine . no issues .
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid : adcea3d3a7c7f9cb944193675bf28cd6 ] ] when you buy these you get two of them , they have 96 led 's in each one . these are great for when you need to help your older security cameras get a better picture . they are very easy to install and are a nice size . when i opened mine you could tell that they were not made cheap , they have a nice metal surround . it is almost like a ir flood light ! when i hooked these up with my cameras that i already had it was perfect . they can light up 262 feet . they are easy to mount and put in the right place that will need help with light ! < br / > i got this item at a discounted price for a honest review !
__label__positive__ camera is great ! some of the extras have limited use .
__label__positive__ great price and does what it 's suppose to do !
__label__positive__ this is an excellent alternative to more expensive action-cameras out there . good video quality and very easy to use . waterproof cover appear effective enough for light underwater use , still need to test it .
__label__neutral__ it 's & # 34 ; okay & # 34 ; the positive is its seems pretty sturdy . the foam grip is well done . i tried mounting both a dslr and a gopro . the dslr balanced well . it had enough weight to it . the gopro mounted just fine . it seemed too light . you could still see the results from my hand shaking in the video . seems like adding just a bit of weight could counter that . i 'll be looking at a different mount for my gopro . i also wished it would come with some type of attachment to mount the camera on top . i had the spring mount for a phone ( like the end of a selfie stick ) but there was n't any type of camera mount screw attachment , just a mold for a slide insert ( that was n't included ) and i borrowed a piece from a gopro accessories kit which it did n't lock in place . had to use a zip tie to keep it from falling out . if someone asked me if it would be worth buying one i 'd sell them mine .
__label__positive__ my daughter loves it thanks
__label__positive__ love it
__label__positive__ i 've used this head for a year now and it works well , except for one problem . i do n't like the size of the quick release plate . i tried to take it off to replace it with one that is standard to the size of the rest of my gear , but i could n't get it off . they welded it on , so even though it has a screw on top , there 's no way to get it off . i stripped the head trying to get the screw out .
__label__negative__ batteries no good . cheap . wo n't charged .
__label__positive__ worked great no issues
__label__neutral__ this one is very average in work , because the mechanism is little bit complicated .
__label__positive__ selfie sticks have become the latest tech craze out there . this hot accessory allows you to take a picture on your phone while being in the picture . no more will you have to give your expensive phone to strangers to do it for you. < br / > < br / > this gmyle aluminum selfie stick is equipped with bluetooth to remotely take your pictures for you , as opposed to a wire that has to be plugged in to the phone . this enables more freedom and portability . and you dont have to worry about wires ripping . there are two buttons on the handle : a shutter button and a power button. < br / > < br / > the clamp that holds the phone is spring loaded to help secure the phone . it has rubber pads which provide ample grip. < br / > the clamps fold flat to ensure maximum portability . removing the clamps reveals a gopro accessory connector which gives you the ability to connect a gopro. < br / > < br / > included in the box is a micro usb wire to charge the unit . always a welcome accessory. < br / > i was provided this product for evaluation and i love it !
__label__neutral__ really helps to crank down on the screw to help reduce movement between the case and the mount , but would be nice if the & # 34 ; handle & # 34 ; portion was a bit longer . price does n't break the bank , but does seem a bit steep for what you get . still , better than using pliers ...
__label__positive__ works well , good day/night mode capabilities . web interface requires bulky java plugins -- uuggh.. < br / > also , the web interface has very old-style user interface , with some advanced settings really difficult to configure . but the advanced settings page has a wealth of features. < br / > < br / > ios app is great to view live video feed. < br / > < br / > motion capture sensitivity is tricky , sometimes it triggers an alert when the camera itself turns from day mode to night mode automatically ! ! < br / > < br / > the camera itself was super easy to setup , with wps button . there is an ethernet port too , but camera over wifi works great ( depends on how fast your wifi is though ) .
__label__positive__ have n't gotten a chance to use it yet but it will come in very handey
__label__positive__ i like the aesthetic of this bag , and it is very roomy . the fact that it could be used for more than just a camera bag is a definite plus . take the padded liner out and you can easily use this as a diaper or overnight bag . it is canvas and has kept my gear dry in a mist , but to call this bag waterproof might be pushing things a bit . the bag definitely does not repel water to the extent of beading it up and rolling it off . i would n't take it in a proper rain , nor would i sit it on a wet surface. < br / > < br / > the straps are heavier canvas , and the 'buckles ' completely aesthetic . the top flap secures with snaps , as do the side closures . the mail compartment also zips closed . the shoulder strap adjusts front points where i could carry the bag at my ribs or down below my knees ( i am 5 ' 3 & # 34 ; ) and is not detachable. < br / > < br / > i would have preferred to have a divider inside the bag , as there is only a little zippered pouch like you would find in a purse , and there is plenty of room inside for the padded insert and other items , but there just is n't any way to keep smaller items from going loose in the bottom of the bag . the front compartment is large enough for a tablet device , but provides no padding as protection . side pockets will not accommodate anything the size of a bottle of water , but maybe some lens cleaning supplies or your phone . ( i do carry a litre water bottle inside the main compartment outside the padded insert though . ) again , these compartments are not padded and no good for delicate camera gear. < br / > < br / > the padded liner has two movable dividers so you can create up to three compartments . i shoot with an olympus micro 4/3 format , so my body ( @ 2x3x5 & # 34 ; ) and lenses are smaller than those you find on regular 4/3 dslr cameras . i can lay my camera on its back with my largest lens ( 7 & # 34 ; ) attached , and still have two other divisions in the insert for two smaller lenses , 2 filter cases , a macro attachment , and room left pver . my lenses are relatively small and can rattle around against each other without some tetris-like arrangement of the lenses and padded filter cases . i would not care to speculate how much gear you could carry , due simply to the sheer range of equipment out there. < br / > < br / > overall , this is a good versatile bag , especially at half the price of other affordable bags of this style.d can rattle around against each other without some tetris-like arrangement of the lenses and padded filter cases . i would not care to speculate how much gear you could carry , due simply to the sheer range of equipment out there. < br / > < br / > overall , this is a good versatile bag , especially at half the price of other affordable bags of this style .
__label__positive__ i own four of these and use them for id checking at events . only catch is that these only work with ids that have magnetic strip on the back - it wo n't read the barcoded type of ids . otherwise - scan is fast , machine is portable and takes aa batteries . i would recommend .
__label__positive__ was very easy to replace and works just as good as the stock one ! ! ! shipping was very fast ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ finest look
__label__positive__ great ! !
__label__positive__ not sure what to say about wires in a review . it has a connecting part on one end , the electricity flows thru the wires inside the insulation , then another connecting part on the other end . i am very pleased with how these wires make my dji inspire 's camera work . so if you want your camera to work on your inspire 1 drone , i highly recommend getting these wires .
__label__negative__ it do n't work at all
__label__positive__ this is a superb lens . it is equivalent to 18-36mm on a 35mm camera . thus it replaces three fixed focal length lenses ( 20 , 24 , and 35 in 35mm ) . i use in on panasonic bodies and it works perfectly . it is very small and convenient . i paid $ 499 for it , which was a $ 200 reduction , due to an olympus lens sale. < br / > < br / > detailed comparisons to other lenses are pointless . you will see no difference in three dimensional real world objects . perhaps if you make huge prints or look at images at 500 % magnification in photoshop you will see something , but not in normal use . of course , you could carry only primes lenses , but that 's three lenses at theses focal lengths and each would cost more than the 9-18 zoom . so , buy this one . you can do superb pictures and nobody will ever know from looking at your work .
__label__positive__ excellent product . strong , light and easily carried on airplanes . brilliant idea . works well with my sonyae7r light-weight full-frame . i 've had several manfrotto products , and i like them all .
__label__positive__ no problems . batteries are now charged and ready to use
__label__positive__ works great ! ! and at a fraction of the cost !
__label__neutral__ comes with florescent lamps ... not bright whites .
__label__positive__ great buy
__label__negative__ only lasted two years before a major common defect with the manual focus lens . many folks reported this issue online . sony has all but abandonded rx1 owners , no firmware updates ar all and now they recommend a shady third party that claims misleading flat rate repairs . the camera was great but i lost my faith in sony imaging products .
__label__positive__ perfect ! bought these for my sis 's wedding and the ones leftover i took with me on a europe tour !
__label__positive__ these batteries cost a fraction of what an original gopro battery cost . it comes with a charging dock and cable . the quality of the cell is very comparable to that of an original go pro battery .
__label__positive__ i have a go pro h3 and i use this . cheaper same quality comes with most accessories extra battery and charger are great would buy again
__label__positive__ this is a nice viewfinder for the canon m camera . i do have to wear my closeup glasses to see the sharp picture . worth the price. < br / > the rubber eye flap is a little large , but can always be trimmed down if needed .
__label__positive__ i 'll start by saying i am an invisibleshield evangelist . i 've been using the zagg product since it came out . for whatever reason , they do n't seem to be making screen protectors for cameras or at least not marketing them ; i searched ... a lot . without a zagg option , i stumbled upon this expert shield brand. < br / > < br / > after receiving this product , i am still an invisibleshield fan-boy , but this product is pretty darn good as well . it 's easier to see through , being more of a plastic material than the silicone-like is . i was expecting a screen ( lcd ) protector but was happy to be surprised by an included top-lcd display protector as well. < br / > < br / > some of these products are cut a bit small , leaving a ( too large ) border around the edge of the lcd . i 'm happy to say the expert shield fits really to size with only the smallest border which is , in my opinion negligible ( 1-2mm overall , maybe ) . the top lcd cover is a little less well fit with more left-right spacing than it should have been . there 's also a curvature to the right-side of the top-lcd and the protector is cut to accommodate this , so like the instructions said , practice before you apply the protectors. < br / > < br / > the installation was quick and this is the first product - including my much beloved is - that i applied without any bubbles. < br / > < br / > it 's really a great product and for the price ? fugheddaboutit . i 'm only nicking it one star for the ill-fit on the top lcd . i 'd nick 'em a half star if i had that option .
__label__negative__ these frames are cheap plastic and they do not work ! i 've been trying to get the company to take them back and give me a refund , to no avail ! do not purchase this product ! complete rip off ! and lousy customer service .
__label__positive__ fast charge , good battery and long duration , i can charge my other batteries
__label__positive__ i bought this battery bank because i wanted an excessively large battery bank that was still portable enough to take camping and leave in the tent , or throw in a backpack for hikes , cycling , and kayaking trips . i use my phone a lot for gps , pictures , music , and more . i also use a bluetooth speaker and other accessories that i would be lost without ! < br / > < br / > the first thing that really strikes me about the mp828 is that it 's built exceptionally well . it has a very heavy-duty feel to it - both the fact that it 's heavy , and it feels like it will really hold up to anything . built to last . the true kmashi advantage - this company makes great items and this battery is a great representation of their quality. < br / > < br / > i took this on my most recent 2-night/3-day camping trip up north , and loved it ! i went with a rustic site to save money ( although i did n't live rustic , mind you ) and this unit kept all of my devices charged for the entire weekend and still had one bar when i went home ! < br / > < br / > this unit kept all of the below devices charged under moderate to heavy use throughout the weekend < br / > < br / > kmashi arma waterproof bluetooth speaker/flashlight < br / > selfie stick < br / > 2x galaxy s5 smartphones < br / > high end dslr camera < br / > usb powered multi led flashlight < br / > usb powered multi led bike light ( clip on ) < br / > < br / > it charged most of the devices at least one full time , with the phones being charged twice to three times each ! < br / > < br / > i 'm surprised it had any life left after the beating it took this weekend , but i was happy . the battery is built well , charges quickly ( especially when using the included high-amp charger ) , and charges devices quickly . make sure to read the small instructions included to make sure you have the correct devices plugged into the correct amperage ports ( generally , just always use the fastest port for powerful devices when it 's available ) . < br / > < br / > i ca n't wait to use this on future trips . it works so well i do n't think i 'll ever need an electric site again , as most gaps are filled by my car 's power as needed for devices that take excessive electricity or need dc . i highly recommend this unit to anyone who wants a ton of power in a small package on the go.an electric site again , as most gaps are filled by my car 's power as needed for devices that take excessive electricity or need dc . i highly recommend this unit to anyone who wants a ton of power in a small package on the go .
__label__positive__ handy size with good power and clear image . not so much a toy like a lot of the other monocular available .
__label__positive__ exactly what i wanted , fast shipping and great price !

__label__positive__ tamrac aria 3 review < br / > as my collection of camera equipment swells , my bags become smaller , but this is my smallest yet . since the camera is hardly ever in it , i decided to go minimal , not that it 's necessary with the aria 3 , which accomodates a surprising amount of stuff . my everyday camera is a medium-sized dslr with a 18-250mm ( larger lens , slightly smaller body than the camera in pic ) . both cameras wear tripod mounts , which is only slightly tight . i could probably swap the mount for an l-bracket , but i 'd have to rethink my gear- same deal if i wanted to use my full-size dslr instead. < br / > no squeezing required , i also carry a charger , extra battery , mem card case , bulb cleaner & cloth , large 10-24mm , collapsible 12 & # 34 ; reflector , lip balm , keys , and cash. < br / > i 'm impressed with the quality of the materials , design , and workmanship.the bag and strap are nicely padded & comfortable to wear . i never worry about anything falling out . the outer fabric seems very durable , the inner is soft & does n't catch on anything . there 's a flat zippered inner compartment on the & # 34 ; body-side & # 34 ; of the bag , flat side pockets , and another zippered pocket on the outside , which is covered when the flap is down . none of those are obvious in the standard photo or drawing . i have zero complaints or pet peeves about this bag , and that 's rare .
__label__positive__ i 've used this card to make color profiles for specific camera/lens combinations in lightroom and it seems to work fine for that . there is no included software , instead you have to use the dng profile editor ( you download that from adobe ) . the only challenge is that i 've had to take several shots in order for the dng profile editor to work as it will complain if the color is not clear . i attribute this issue to my photography skill. < br / > < br / > here is a video on how to use the dng profile editor with this card in anyone is interested : < br / > < br / > https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=sdiqbl7eufa
__label__positive__ product packaging solid , fully < br / > applicable to outdoor sports , good < br / > quality , practical , i have used the < br / > suction cup and it did a fantastic < br / > job , and will use other accessories < br / > for a free time .
__label__neutral__ hard to operate .
__label__positive__ amazing lens . compare this to the canon version and you can not beat the price . for a grand less you get just as good of a product . minus some very small differences they only real downfall of this lens compared to canon is you do n't get the white lens with the red ring ! certainly worth it to me for $ 1,000 less. < br / > < br / > only con i can find : the zoom ring goes in the opposite direction from all other canon lenses . not sure why they designed it this way , but if you shoot with primarily canon lenses it will be tricky to shoot quickly every time you switch to this lens .
__label__positive__ i love this lens hood . i have always like the flexibility of a quality rubber lens hood and this one fits perfectly and is a nice size and shape . it was well packaged ( although would be hard to break ) and arrived on time . bravo !
__label__positive__ this is a tricky lens to review . it has a lot of compromises , but it 's also very inexpensive . i saw it prime for less than a hundred dollars and could n't pass it up . i think it 's a bargain for the price , provided you take it for what it is . i have used this lens on sony mirrorless cameras , not canon . it 's a t-mount lens so it will work on pretty much any camera . i just bought the canon version because it had the best price. < br / > < br / > the lens is 800mm , manual focus , and fixed at f8.0 aperture . the fixed f8.0 aperture is the main limitation . shooting hand held at 800mm f8.0 requires a higher shutter speed and possibly a higher iso even in broad daylight . it takes some care and practice to focus 800mm manually hand held , but it can be done . the focus ring is stiff on my copy and i did n't have any problems with the lens holding focus . the entire barrel of the lens moves to focus so it 's tricky to hold onto the lens without also changing the focus . i was able to get reasonable focus even hand-held by pre-magnifying my evf to the maximum and then moving the subject into the magnified area to focus and then immediately shooting with a fast shutter speed . this works fine on stationary subjects . very difficult on moving subjects. < br / > < br / > the characteristic donut bokeh is also a problem and must be kept in mind . with some practice , you can predict what kinds of backgrounds are going to result in ugly bokeh and which will be ok and try to frame accordingly . at fixed f8.0 , you ca n't control the depth of field except by moving your feet , which means there are many shots that just ca n't work . it 's a compromise , but for the price it 's hard to complain. < br / > < br / > i also bought a cheap 2x t-mount teleconverter which i found to be pretty useless . the image sharpness is decreased by more than 2.0x , so you 're better off just cropping in post. < br / > < br / > i 've attached a few quick test photos taken with this lens . the flower image was taken with a sony a6000 on atripod , 1200mm effective , 1/250 f8.0 iso 100 . note that the out of focus yellow flower in the background looks ok to my eye , but the black flower in the upper left is distracting . the others were taken on a sony a7ii hand held at midday . 800mm , f8.0 , various shutter speeds all 1/250 or faster , iso 400 and 800 . the a7ii has in body image stabilization ( ibis ) which was extremely helpful in handholding this lens. < br / > < br / > so to summary : < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > * sharp in the center if you nail focus < br / > * the cheapest and lightest 800mm you 're going to find. < br / > * you can carry it all day long and take it places you would never take a normal super telephoto. < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > * fixed f8.0 puts a lot of restrictions on you due to available light considerations and donut bokeh effect < br / > * focusing is hard to do hand held. < br / > * poor micro contrast , sharpness drops off from the center < br / > < br / > so is this a viable alternative to your canon 800mm f5.6l ? of course not . is it a fun alternative to not having a super telephoto at all ? sure .
__label__positive__ nice product
__label__positive__ great product
__label__negative__ while the tubes do n't lock up on my lenses like others have noted , they are not rigid . any change in pressure on the lens causes them to flex considerably .
__label__positive__ perfect
__label__positive__ really good , but with the time the water breaks in
__label__positive__ bought as a gift - no feedback yet . i have used one of these , however , and suggest to users to not be ham-handed . if you treat it with care , do n't overtighten things and disregard the & # 34 ; professional & # 34 ; moniker , you should be fine . professional tripods cost many times more and can take a fair amount of abuse . this one ? abuse at your own risk - and risk to your cameras , etc . as an amateur photographer , i would buy one for my own use in a minute .
__label__positive__ i 'm new to the hobby . i chose this model after reading numerous reviews and guides and watching countless youtube videos , and i have not been disappointed . it flies well , it 's easily controllable , it 's very end user serviceable and it 's ridiculously durable . it 's the perfect beginners quadcopter that experienced pilots will still enjoy. < br / > < br / > stability : it hovers well and flies very smoothly . it gets carried a bit by wind , but with a skillful enough hand , you can account for winds in the 10-15 mph range with little difficulty , but watch out flying around trees in the wind . gusts will catch you , so you 'll want to be in open space if you have windy conditions. < br / > < br / > maneuverability : in low rate , it 's a stable , controllable , and not too fast quad that 's great to learn on . in high rate , it 's a nimble , acrobatic flyer that you 'll have a lot of fun with no matter your skill level. < br / > < br / > camera : the camera is rather poor . the images are low quality . the videos are a bit better than the stills , but you are n't going to mistake this for professional gear . out of the box , the camera is pointed down at too much of an angle , so you mostly record the ground and see very little of the horizon . it 's pretty simple to modify by cutting a block of the foam from the packing material around the transmitter as a shim , and using a couple of the blade guard screws to replace the camera screws ( see attached picture ) . that will give you a nearly level camera that will take pictures and video at a much better angle . you 'll also want to balance your blades . this quad can make almost completely smooth video , but the blades have to be balanced. < br / > < br / > durability : it 's been crashed numerous times . it 's been stuck 70 ' up in a tree ( and subsequently retrieved through a combination of bow and arrow , deep sea fishing line , and rope ) . a friend 's has been stuck in a tree through a severe thunderstorm . mine has only needed a new propeller and motor gear . his only needed a gear . these things are basically indestructible . when you 're flying outside , take off the blade guards . blades are cheap and the guards get stuck in foliage far too easily. < br / > < br / > serviceability : there are tons of parts available for this quad . as long as you have the mainboard and transmitter , you can rebuild the entire thing from parts for less than $ 30 . you can take the entire thing down to parts with only the screwdriver in the box . add a soldering iron and there 's nothing you ca n't do to it . in short , this quad is made to be serviced. < br / > < br / > moddability : the quad is very moddable . from custom colored blades and blade guards to fpv cameras , commercially made mods are plentiful , and it 's serviceable enough that there are even more diy mods . you 'll never get bored with what you can do with this quad. < br / > < br / > bottom line : i ca n't recommend this quad enough . if you are a beginner , this is the perfect quad to practice on . get a few extra batteries , and you can have a great time flying this almost anywhere.indestructible . when you 're flying outside , take off the blade guards . blades are cheap and the guards get stuck in foliage far too easily . serviceability : there are tons of parts available for this quad . as long as you have the mainboard and transmitter , you can rebuild the entire thing from parts for less than $ 30 . you can take the entire thing down to parts with only the screwdriver in the box . add a soldering iron and there 's nothing you ca n't do to it . in short , this quad is made to be serviced . moddability : the quad is very moddable . from custom colored blades and blade guards to fpv cameras , commercially made mods are plentiful , and it 's serviceable enough that there are even more diy mods . you 'll never get bored with what you can do with this quad . bottom line : i ca n't recommend this quad enough . if you are a beginner , this is the perfect quad to practice on . get a few extra batteries , and you can have a great time flying this almost anywhere .
__label__negative__ returned it . cheap . head not fluid .
__label__positive__ no comments
__label__positive__ just what i needed , priced resonable and shipping was n't outragous .
__label__positive__ great design !
__label__positive__ good product
__label__positive__ i 've had this camera for a long time and have never had a problem with it . great purchase
__label__negative__ camera did not last 3 days of use . we bought it for a cruise trip and it would not turn on on day 3 . we are very careful and the camera was never hit or dropped . in contrast an old fuji waterproof camera with 3-4 years of use continue to do is job . at least the pictures in th memory card survived . i would not buy this model again .
__label__positive__ able to see performers at concerts easily with them .
__label__positive__ love this lens .
__label__neutral__ functions , but finicky .
__label__positive__ this bag is perfect ! ! ! ! we bought it to take around the san diego zoo and sea world . it distributes the weight so well that you can barely tell you are wearing it . my camera and 3 lenses stayed snug inside the bag . perfect camera bag .
__label__positive__ it seems to be made well . the clamp feels strong and the gopro end looks to be made of the same material as regular gopro mounts . to use , you need to unscrew the bolt from the nut on the end , to fit the handlebar . then when it is on snugly , latch it closed . i like it so far and the cost was not bad . i definitely recommend this .
__label__positive__ grandson loves it
__label__positive__ works with my cannon , great deal
__label__positive__ nice
__label__positive__ lanyard broke but still works good
__label__positive__ very happy with these batteries they have worked 14-15 cycles so far flawlessly . i will admit i get hesitant buying non-oem batteries and i am very glad i took a chance on these . the batteries have been fantastic and the charger has even been of more value to me . the charger charges all of my sony camera batteries and those of you that have a sony mirrorless system know you burn though more than a couple with a full day of shooting and this charger quickly charges all of my batteries . would highly recommend this purchase for anyone with a mirrorless sony system ! !
__label__positive__ wife loves it
__label__positive__ have n't used it yet , but it seems well made and should do the trick !
__label__negative__ the stick barley expands and it 's very hard to get to go back down . biggest waste of money ever
__label__negative__ did n't work was n't the right connector for my sony as it said it was . no refunds so i 'm screwed .
__label__positive__ so far it 's been great
__label__positive__ love , love , love it
__label__positive__ nice
__label__negative__ do not buy this case . the positive reviews on here are for the actual gimbal that it holds , not for the case . the case is thin cheap aluminum and will not protect your stuff . i could easily break this with minimal effort . this case can be bought at harbor freight for much cheaper .
__label__negative__ one can take a picture with this adapter but the auto focus function does not work . what 's worse is that your camera will not tell you whether the object is in focus ( the green dot does appear ) when you do manual focus , you will have to rely on what you see through the view finder to determine if the object is in focus . if you change the zoom , not the focus , though , sometimes you can get the green dot coming up . i had a replacement , but neither works . i am returning it for refund . i sincerely hope that fotodiox fully tests its products before putting them on the market .
__label__negative__ could n't get the wrinkles out
__label__negative__ i do n't typically respond to these reviews , but i think , and feel , it necessary to do so with this one : i returned the first clock/camera because it stopped working ( recording ) after a short time , now the second one is doing the same . spygeargadgets does n't always respond to my emails . once , they said something to the effect , & # 34 ; oh , you did n't get the email & # 34 ; ? the last one said , & # 34 ; sorry for the delay in getting back with you - we 've released a few new products and we 've been incredibly busy. & # 34 ; the product description stated & # 34 ; one year warranty. & # 34 ; i proposed they refund my money , as i do n't want to pay the postage ( again ) to ship it back to them and potentially have the same problem a 3rd ( 4th , 5th etc ) time . they did respond to that email saying & # 34 ; at this point the order is several months old , so we would n't be able to offer a refund. & # 34 ; the fact is i have n't had this camera for & # 34 ; several months. & # 34 ; i have gone to another company , had no problems with their products . i wo n't be going back to spygeargadgets ; my experience with them says this product is unreliable and their communication with me was the same . i guess i 'll have to take the financial loss here , but guess what , you do n't have to ! i have saved my correspondence with them just in case i need to back up my statements . they can keep the money , but they must have forgotten the power of the ( non-returning ) customer in these reviews . i 'm done with them .
__label__positive__ fits cannon sx60 with adapter ring , uv filter and polarizer lens perfect and snug lots of comments on the dark brown case and it 's easier and quicker access than fooling around with a zippered case , pretty rugged and durable and does n't scratch as easy as i thought it would
__label__positive__ awesome and remember this is not a toy !
__label__positive__ love the camera , but would have liked the seller to advertise that camera does not have u.s. warranty .
__label__positive__ they 're batteries . they charge . they fit my camera ( canon t3i ) perfectly . i always have 3 batteries with me , and i 've never run out of juice , so for the price they 're well worth it !
__label__positive__ this was a great deal ! every other website had this camera brand new for $ 300 i managed to get a wonderful deal on this and could n't be happier . the quality of picture it takes is incredible and the side screen that flips out and rotates is awesome . this is a must buy for anyone who is looking for a mobile camera that is small and convenient .
__label__positive__ charger works great and is simple to use .
__label__positive__ great for the price
__label__positive__ amazing heavy stand , holds my kupo baby boom rock solid
__label__negative__ the rgb values and what is actually printed are way off ! ! ! only the white balance portion is half decent and even that . stay away from this product .
__label__neutral__ these were not very durable and the photos were deleted easily .
__label__positive__ product as described . delivered as projected .
__label__negative__ cameras started messing up after 6 months .
__label__positive__ good gift . this camera case is great for the right size camera .
__label__positive__ works well on my sony a6000 . for those that do not know , you will have to manually set focus and aperture when using this adapter . there is no power/drive being sent to the lens to tell it what to do .
__label__positive__ it is difficult to fly , but that may be my learning curve . it is a good copter to learn on . shortly after i bought this , a representative of the company called to ask if i was satisfied . i was impressed .
__label__positive__ the best out of the box drone for the money .
__label__negative__ rather bulky , not like the original . it does charge but i was very thankful when i found my original one again !
__label__negative__ at first , it was cute but the gentle wind blew the tripod down and the umbrella arms/support bent and collapsed . i then bought another thinking that it was my fault but then it was nudged and the umbrella fell against a wall and snapped the arms again . if you tried to bend it back like how you would when your rain umbrella flips inside out , it would completely break . the metal support inside the umbrella is very thin and cheaply made . not happy at all . save your money and spend a few more dollars to get a quality umbrella .
__label__positive__ excellent !
__label__positive__ could n't be happier with this tripod ! ! it securely holds the camera very light weight ! very easy to us ! all around a great product !
__label__positive__ works just as stated
__label__positive__ great deal . works well as motorcycle camera . will likely buy a couple more for additional battery life .
__label__positive__ works very good on my helmet and very pleased . thanks ! !
__label__positive__ this was a birthday gift for someone who has wanted a nice camera for a long time . she loves it and is thrilled with all it can do .
__label__positive__ i have used mine for the last ski season on my helmet , am very happy with it . but buy fast sdmc chip for it ( high transfer rate ) and it works great . heck of a deal with all the accessories . is n't a gopro but it also is n't $ 400
__label__positive__ it fits perfectly , however water gets between the camera and jacket and it needs to be removed to dry the camera . it seems sand could get in with water ( think beach ) and could scratch the camera ; the camera would probably be better without it at the beach or in wet conditions . i think a good use for the jacket would be for dry/dirty/dusty conditions . it seems the jacket is for protecting the paint in dry conditions where bumping or scratching may be an issue , or where extra grip may be needed . if you desire a silicone jacket , this is about as good as it gets , not sure , however , that the tg-830 needs one .
__label__positive__ very good i would recommend the sky master .
__label__positive__ love this camera , makes cute business card size pictures .
__label__positive__ for the price hard to beat . zoom exceeded expectations . purchasing a 64gb memory card will give you thousands of quality pictures at highest settings .
__label__positive__ good product with great price ... thanks for cooperating
__label__negative__ within the first 3 months , 5 of the cameras ceased to operate correctly . funlux tech support is virtually non existent . tired emailing and calling for 2 weeks with no response . today i tired calling , and their line does n't ring through .
__label__negative__ the hand strap is to large . where you plug in the pc cable is under a rubber flap that is held on one small rubber cord.it does n't have a lens cover. < br / > it 's made of some kind of plastic . the viewing screen does n't turn .
__label__negative__ simply did n't work ... bought 2 thinking first one was defective ... got 2nd one ... .same results . < br / > kept giving me same reading regardless if i increase intensity of my flash or light source ... .or near pitch darkness .
__label__positive__ great service , i got exactly what i asked for .
__label__positive__ the bacpac performs really well , very happy with it .
__label__positive__ i love the strap , but it was shipped with an off brand attachment , not the black rapid fastenr-3
__label__positive__ really great product and at an exceptional price .
__label__negative__ filters and case were missing , returning this for a refund . all i received was the adapter rings
__label__positive__ this seems a really great kit for cleaning lenses.i was after the brush and blower , but , except for the pen , the rest of the stuff works well . i 'm particularly pleased with how well the microfiber cloths work. < br / > < br / > i was unable to figure out how to use the lens cleaning pen . the end with the carbon cleaner marked my lens , but i was eventually able to remove the greasy black mark with judicious use of the microfiber cloth . the brush end did remove some of the dust , but left bristles behind on the lens . the blower worked fairly well at getting rid of the bristles. < br / > < br / > since all the other stuff works well , i give four stars . use rubber gloves to pick up the unbranded lens cleaning pen ( manufactured nowhere ) and dispose of it responsibly .
__label__positive__ a bit of breaking in and it 's smooth. < br / > practice makes perfect .
__label__positive__ got it early , thought i needed it but did n't . keeping it as a spare

__label__positive__ rambling on time ... .i owned the great x-t1 a little while back but ended up going a different direction . well , i decided to come back to fuji ( mainly for the amazing jpg quality since i get bored with always post processing raw ) and was about to get the x-t1 again . went to dpreview just to check things out and saw that fuji had this camera out . dpreview only gave it silver , but i dug deeper and read more reviews including forum posts . it really came down to what i typically shoot vs what items listed below that were different than the x-t1 that made me go with this camera. < br / > < br / > 1 ) smaller size - smaller size with same great sensor ( yes , it is still the same one , but why fix what aint broke ? ) is exactly what i wanted < br / > 2 ) smaller buffer - i do n't typically need 15+ burst shots for what i shoot . that being said , i do tend to get more than what reviewers had posted . shooting jpg fine with shutter speed at 1/1000 i get 15 shots before it starts slowing down . that is plenty for what i would use it for. < br / > 3 ) small flash - not really a difference since the x-t1 had a small flash as well ( external ) . i actually find it very useful . works well for general picts family , pets etc. < br / > 4 ) less dials on top - i really liked the dials on the x-t1 . the way the x-t10 is setup is great . so easy , and fast , to switch shutter speed , aperture and iso . they really thought things out. < br / > 5 ) smaller evf - noticeable for sure , but not bad at all . the x-t1 had an amazing evf and the x-t10 is a really good one . i really do n't even think about it vs the x-t1. < br / > 6 ) smaller fixed eye cup - thought it would be an issue , but i actually like it. < br / > 7 ) not weather sealed - not important to me . people tend to over rate this item imho . many forget that you are only as good as you weakest link . if you do n't own a lens that is weather sealed you are in trouble anyway. < br / > < br / > ok , so those things out of the way . you still get the phenomenal out of camera jpg . yes , phenomenal is the right word . fuji colors pop and are the most accurate i have ever used . add their customizable & # 34 ; film simulations ' and omg what a treat . you basically get all the fuji films of the past in your camera with tweaking allowed . so much customization is what finally wraps up why i love fuji . from the many buttons you can adjust to the great customizable & # 34 ; q & # 34 ; menu you can just set up what ever you need to do things easy and fast. < br / > < br / > oh yeah ... focus speed and accuracy . some have complained that they get a lot of out of focus shots . i just do n't see it . granted i use single point mainly , but it is pretty much dead on for me . i also find the focus speed to be extremely fast in good light and still really fast in low light especially if you use the center 15 points what have phase detection . the hybrid af in this area uses both contrast and phase detection which i find works really well in low light. < br / > < br / > ok ... enough rambling . i would love to go into depth on the great fuji lenses but you can read up on each of them . i do keep the 23mm f1.4 on my camera most of the time . 3d like quality.e right word . fuji colors pop and are the most accurate i have ever used . add their customizable & # 34 ; film simulations ' and omg what a treat . you basically get all the fuji films of the past in your camera with tweaking allowed . so much customization is what finally wraps up why i love fuji . from the many buttons you can adjust to the great customizable & # 34 ; q & # 34 ; menu you can just set up what ever you need to do things easy and fast. < br / > < br / > oh yeah ... focus speed and accuracy . some have complained that they get a lot of out of focus shots . i just do n't see it . granted i use single point mainly , but it is pretty much dead on for me . i also find the focus speed to be extremely fast in good light and still really fast in low light especially if you use the center 15 points what have phase detection . the hybrid af in this area uses both contrast and phase detection which i find works really well in low light. < br / > < br / > ok ... enough rambling . i would love to go into depth on the great fuji lenses but you can read up on each of them . i do keep the 23mm f1.4 on my camera most of the time . 3d like quality .
__label__negative__ nikon is a great name in cameras . got a chance to get an s70 really cheap . was impressed by the features listed . so what happened to make me give it just 2 stars ? it just wo n't take a clear crisp picture . image quality is just plain blurry . i own several cameras from point and shoot to dslr and even the lowliest of my other cameras can beat out this one in image quality hands down . i have tried scene modes , faster shutter speeds , using the top button instead of tapping the screen to take the picture , nothing helps . so my advice is do n't do it !
__label__negative__ not so good .
__label__negative__ chinese language firmware and pal video format . why is this being sold in united states and why is there no indication of this in the description . i sent mine back . have 4 others installed , ntsc , english language . very happy with those . now i have to find out how to be sure i get the correct version for my use .
__label__negative__ charger very hard to use . i went through 2 and still had to jiggle the battery to start charging . also went through 3 digipower batteries . they last around 4 to 5 charges then will charge no more .
__label__negative__ instructions and mud synonymous .
__label__negative__ i 've been using two older model foscam 's before and have been reasonably happy with them . so i decided to pick up a fi9821p due to improved specs . unfortunately it 's pretty much impossible to set this camera up without installing a proprietary browser extension on internet explorer ( really , are people still using this ? ) . you ca n't even set this camera up with chrome ... the next issue i ran into is that it ca n't handle some valid characters in the wpa2 password i 'd setup , requiring me to change it for all other devices on the network . the video quality is pretty good once you get it to work and as i 'm primarily accessing it from a few android devices running ip cam viewer i do n't have to deal with the user interface too much . seeing how poor the web-interface is designed i 'm glad that i decided to isolate it on it 's own virtual lan so if it does get penetrated no access to my personal lan is possible . the last firmware update is from 2014 .
__label__positive__ dany did an outstanding job being patient with me. < br / > the camara is very good .
__label__positive__ very useful for outdoor carrying
__label__positive__ it 's awesome so can i get one free ? ? ?
__label__positive__ it 's just a great little lens as others have said . works well for astrophotography . a small amount of coma wide open but stopped down to f4 it 's great .
__label__positive__ definitely impressed with the video and sound quality . the ez configuration tool is great for updating the firmware and configuring the settings . best results were achieved with vga , 60hz , pal , +2 exposure
__label__positive__ thanks ... ! !
__label__positive__ this is our second of the exact same camera in our family , as our son is getting older and wanting to do more on his own , this is a perfect camera to give him to document his adventures- summer camp does n't allow electronics , but they are allowed cameras , so he can use in and out of lakes and know it will be consistently good ! ! we use for snorkeling all over and the quality is great for this size camera , i am pleased with the price point , and this bundle is a steal with other sites selling just the camera for the same price as the bundle ! !
__label__negative__ for me , the photos were too blurry to be acceptable . and it did n't work well in low light settings .
__label__positive__ works as it should to be .
__label__positive__ great package at a great price . however , i am tired of getting the lens cleaner kit with my purchases . i now have three sets . and does everyone have to send the micro cleaning cloth with their products . i understand with lenses , but not with batteries .
__label__positive__ i have many smoke detectors and i was looking for a charger for reusable batteries . i did received the product free of charge , and was pleased with its features ; this model was said to be & # 34 ; smart & # 34 ; . it also supports recharging both li-ion and nimh 9v batteries , so i 'd have the flexibility to get the best battery deals. < br / > there are four independent charging slots and each feature a display that tells you the state of the battery and charge status. < br / > < br / > function keys show mode of the charge status and can be done for each battery slot separately . you can tell the charge status and how long the charging process is taking. < br / > < br / > there is also a test mode where you can check the current charge of a battery to see if it needs charging. < br / > < br / > there is not a temperature check - but not many chargers of this size do n't have that - so it is important to check batteries for heat while charging for long periods of time. < br / > < br / > the only other thing is if you charge lilon batteries , you need to use protective mode batteries , or the charging will not stop and can cause heat issues ; for nimh batteries , once charged , a trickle charge is applied to keep the battery at its max until you need to use them . so i think i 'll use nimh batteries most of the time. < br / > < br / > overall , this is a great price for the best 9v smart battery charger i could find ! another money saving purchase ...
__label__positive__ when ordering this camera we were a little skeptical that for this price the camera really had an active zoom lens the we could control with our iphone . we had to see it to believe it . but sure enough it worked great ! the camera itself does n't move , but you can optically zoom in and out . what 's also pretty neat is that even though the camera stays in-focus all the time , the focus can be tweaked using the phone or dvr interface too . so you do n't have to worry about focus or zoom level ( like our other vari-focal cameras ) during installation . just get it pointing the right direction and then go back to the dvr to focus , set the zoom level . on top of this you can do a digital zoom too , but this is true of all our regular cameras too . as far as the picture itself , the quality is excellent . good at night too . we love to watch the occasional raccoon and other animals that wonder into our yard at all hours of the night .
__label__negative__ i bought it for my nikon d3200 but it has jvc written on it which hides the nikon in my camera screen and showing jvc which looks so wrong . < br / > i ca n't recommend it to anyone who does n't have jvc . i am disappointed .
__label__negative__ the case i received appears to be a counterfeit and a bad one at that . the logo is damaged and mis-aligned . even the glue at the logo is showing . the stitching is uneven and frayed .
__label__positive__ i got what i ordered , and considering that just one lens cap holder alone was $ 3.49 at target , this was a huge bargain . lens caps fit my nikon d3200 lenses perfectly . the only thing that was strange , was that all the lens caps came with a long looped string attached , besides the separate lens cap holders , and no instructions , i really had no idea what it was for , or where to attach them , so i wound up just cutting them off and attached the holders . the holders are better , because they 're shorter , and you can remove them quickly if you need to and just put it around your wrist . i am notorious for setting my caps down , or putting them in my pocket ... .and lose them quickly , so this is going to be a great addition to my photography hobbies .
__label__positive__ not bad for the price , not the best quality .
__label__positive__ work well . compatible with charger and camera
__label__positive__ love it all . no problems .
__label__positive__ perfect for square filters - i carry 3 neutral density filters and 3 more special effect filters for ready use . well made pouch - protects the filters and keeps them ready for use and organized . this would be a bargain at three times the price . a small price compared to the cost of professional filters !
__label__positive__ fits perfect showed up fast .
__label__positive__ bought this to store/carry all parts for sylvania 9-inch portable dvd players ( 2 screens ) . both players fit along with all the cords , chargers , etc . and 2 dvds . perfect .
__label__negative__ taped thru the middle all the way across . folded like an accordion so folds wo n't come out..ca n't use as a background .
__label__positive__ great quality and really helps contrast the moon . the moon can be soo bright without the filter you tend to see spots without it , especially on a full moon .
__label__positive__ everything in the kit is great
__label__positive__ this is a great product .
__label__neutral__ it 's okay , some pictures came out great . others looked like webcam quality. < br / > < br / > sucks up batteries though . bring lots of batteries .
__label__negative__ even with the harness strapped to a 80 lb lab , it < br / > makes a horrible clicking noise in the video . i am using a gopro & # 34 ; clip & # 34 ; to attach it to the harness and yes the screw was wrenched down . spend your money on the real thing from gopro .
__label__positive__ the product was delivered in a timely manner . it was purchased for a new canon 70d dslr . it fits well , but it is a bit loose . it falls off in my camera bag , as i 'm removing the camera . while using the camera there is no problem .
__label__positive__ what i was looking for
__label__positive__ excellent , configurable controls , lightweight , below average battery life , good picture quality , fussy auto focus in low light and macro . the photo quality is not what all the glowing reviews state . it is as good an entry level dslr like a canon rebel , because it has the same size aps c sensor , but no better . but it is a smaller camera , that 's why i bought it . also , keep in mind that it is a fixed lens with no zoom . overall , a well-built , pocketable and powerful tool with a few flaws . buy it for the size and price . for super sharp images you 'll have to pay twice the price and size . update : i 've been using the camera for 2 weeks and have processed a number of images ( raw , using lightroom ) and i 'm upgrading my opinion . the images are sharp , vivd and the the color balance is spot on . ( see examples ) . the camera interface is outstanding- very natural to use . just buy a soft case with a belt strap , and a wrist strap and you can take it anywhere .
__label__positive__ great price for the cleaning set . the purosol solution really cleaned up my lens after snapping pics at a teppanyaki restaurant . it would be nice to have an extra pack of altura lens paper .
__label__positive__ i left this case on the back of my truck and when i drove off it fell off onto the highway . it got run over and i went back to check it out and he case did its job . my gopro is perfectly fine
__label__positive__ i love it i just have reduce the # of things i carry . i carry a flash , 3 lenses , camera a battery grip and extra batteries .
__label__positive__ did what it needed too .
__label__positive__ works fine
__label__neutral__ works great range is weak though . had to stand about 5 feet away to make it work
__label__positive__ performs as presented , great camera for long trips .
__label__negative__ it does n't fit everything without bulging out the sides and it looks like it will break open so ca n't use it as designed : (
__label__positive__ i bought this battery charger to charge my np-fv30 batteries for my hdr-cx230 sony handycam . at first i was not sure how to get the battery to fit in the charger . thankfully the seller called me and taught me the proper way to push the battery into charger instead of sliding it in . i reccomend the charger .
__label__positive__ i was looking for a light for my make-shift document copy stand ( for copying historical documents in libraries where scanners are n't allowed ) , and decided the price was worth the risk for this item . the light turned out to be perfect ! < br / > < br / > it provides around 700 lux of additional lighting at a distance of 2 feet , the spread is relatively even , and the color temp is around 4900k , which strikes a good middle ground between warm incandescent and cool daylight . dimming works great , there is no noticeable flicker . i 'll probably buy a second one to light my documents from the other side ( to further even out the lighting ) . < br / > < br / > the only & # 34 ; con & # 34 ; i can think of is that the placement of aa batteries is somewhat finicky -- it 's not hard to put in a battery in a way that does n't connect well with the contacts . at first i thought i had a doa unit , but wiggling the batteries , i found the culprit .
__label__positive__ the products are excellent and they were delivered in a very timely manner . i am very pleased .
__label__positive__ fantastic fpv camera . so much better than using a mobius for fpv .
__label__positive__ every item purchase has met or exceeded my expectations. < br / > < br / > thank you. < br / > < br / > ron baireuther
__label__positive__ here is a just-got-it , digging-it review . time will tell if i edit this to address any issues. < br / > < br / > this is a great walk-around lens that gives me the range that i want without the bulk of the kit lens . i am using it on an olympus om-d e-m10 and the two together are an awesome combination . focus is quick , zoom is powered which is a bit different from every other m4/3 lens that i have in my kit . but i am slowly getting used to that . i do wish that olympus would include the lens cap that automatically opens with this lens . i will probably spring for that at some point , hopefully before i lose the simple cap that came in the box .
__label__negative__ wow ... how bad can bad be ? when a company ca n't seem to even keep the ir led used for night time viewings from leaking into the lens housing ! as such , it fogs the image . you can tell it is light leakage from the inside as you can clearly see the defined circle of the lens , thus it is reflecting from within and seeing the lens . ( see photo ) now add to that how messed up the firmware is and also something as simple as focus , not being set correctly and you can not adjust it without opening the housing and voiding the warranty , and you can start to see how this camera seems to have no quality control standards and would just rather mass produce it to keep the price down . the firmware has too many & # 34 ; issues & # 34 ; to list ... right down to them removing features that were requested by past users that were added , but are no longer ... ie ... an ftp upload option to use the same file name this overwriting the current image . ( think web cam static shots updated like every 5 mins for weather views or views from a park , beach , etc . ) nope ... now it sends up files all with unique time stamps as file names . thus you can no longer just embed the image via html to call the image ! ! ! had to write a custom cron job on the web server to change the file name . then the spam , oh the spam , the company sends . and get this ! ! ! they make it hard to set this up without going though their & # 34 ; cloud service & # 34 ; to set it up . i really do not care to give them access to my login for my camera . what i mean by & # 34 ; they make it hard & # 34 ; is that they even change the http port to be 88 vs the standard 80 so you can not connect to it directly unless you know this . seeing they are trying to get you to use their cloud service , this may be way the firmware is so very , very poor . no information is given as to how to connect to the camera directly to set it up . do n't take my word for it , see the other review on the issues another buy had and how he also documented it . the best part is it shows greatreviews for this camera ... but read between the lines for the shill reviews . they have a lot of & # 34 ; posters & # 34 ; . this is such a shame as this company is surely going backwards vs forward as they used to have a good cam , at a fair price , that worked ! firmware and all . and it could be used with a mac and chrome browser . now you can not unless you hack your browser . i am writing this as a long time foscam user with over 17 camera that were setup on our past property . however , after now using 3 of their new 720p cameras , all with issues , i do not think i will be looking to foscam in the future !
__label__negative__ do n't buy this charger . i 've had it for about 4 months now and although it seems two discharged ( flashlight ) batteries are recharged they only last an hour when put to reuse. < br / > then i left it out in the rain . well , that was the end of that . not efficient and anything but robust . there 's got to be a better way
__label__positive__ when i first received the smapole s3 , i immediately trying to go through the flaws of the poles first . i tried and tried but just can not find any functioning flaws for the pole. < br / > < br / > -the construction is in very high quality . the carbon fiber feels great in hand and does not slip out of hand in water , it retains a firm grip in underwater shots . it also floats in water , eliminates the fear of the pole sinks . the aluminum has a nice finish and feels very strong . a tripod mount can be removed , so you can add other types of mount on there. < br / > < br / > -top extension of the pole feels like the s1 pole , with similar sponge grip and twist extension . the twist extension is a wonderful feature that you can easily extends or contracts and it stays that way . very firm extension. < br / > < br / > -the pole can survive salt water . i 've deep sea dived with the pole 2 times now and it does not accrue any rust . just need to quickly rinse and air dry the pole so the salt stick due to salt water. < br / > < br / > -very portable . i can easily detach the 2 parts and pop it into my backpack without it poking outside. < br / > < br / > ***my most favorite feature of the pole is that the bottom of the carbon fiber you can attach a tripod stand to it ! ! ! such an awesome feature that earned this pole 5 stars for its versatility . you can unscrew the rope and attach a tripod stand of choice and the gopro can now shoot awesome times lapse ! you ca n't find this feature in any of the other poles. < br / > < br / > overall i give this product a 4.7/5 < br / > with this price point for a gopro pole a tripod stand at the bottom accessory is suggested to be included with the pole to fully utilize its potential . other than that it 's a perfect pole !
__label__positive__ great products thanks..
__label__positive__ been using this for my daily commutes for about a week . no major problems to report , but one interesting 'glitch ' . because the camera is mounted in front and slightly below my bars there was enough room to move my gps from the stem to the bar . for some reason , when in that configuration with the camera recording , my gps does not get a satellite signal . turn the camera off ... gps works . turn the camera on ... gps says no satellites found . moved the gps back to the stem , all is happy and fine . i could probably wrap the camera in foil to block the emi but not worth the trouble. < br / > < br / > received this yesterday , so for now , it ’ s a first impression review. < br / > i commute to work on an almost daily basis . about 45 minutes each way . over the years i ’ ve only had one significant run in with an aggressive driver . maybe it ’ s the time of day , usually before the sun rises going to work , normally after 5pm on the evening trip . most of it on a secondary road , so no city traffic either . cycling keeps me sane . but anyway , let ’ s get back to the review . i ’ ve been using one of my gopro h4 ’ s to record my commute , just in case . the gopro is a pain . it has too many features and button presses for my needs . also , daily charging is a pain . it has to be removed from the case . but mostly i hated how conspicuous it looked mounted the commuter bike . i try to be euro cool while riding . if i record somebody i don ’ t want them to immediately notice the relatively obvious plastic box . studies have shown that knowledge of being recorded changes the outcome of the interaction . outcomes can go either way , so i just want to capture the ‘ decisive moment ’ as henri cartier-bresson explained it . other action cameras under consideration were a garmin virb , or ion air . but i didn ’ t feel like throwing down another $ 200 bucks . this was purpose built and cheap . enter the sumsonic s300 extreme , also branded as ishare s300. < br / > the camera comes with a variety of mounting options . it uses the now ubiquitous gopro standard mount . i charged it up then inserted a 16gb standard size sd card ( thanks now i have a use for the drawer of sd cards ) i took the bike for a spin around the block . the video quality at 720p was not bad . it ’ s sufficient to read a license plate or capture the angry driver for that chance encounter . with 16 gigs installed the camera reported recording time of 1hr 40 min at 720p and 1 hr 20 min at 1080p. < br / > this am i took it out for its first real world spin . i got on the road as dawn was breaking . with my 1200 lumen bike light the recording did not look too bad . not a lot of objects beyond the beam were clearly visible . my gopro ’ s the same , so it was expected . when the sun came up the video quality was significantly improved . i won ’ t bore you with the sounds of road rumble , cars passing , and my grunting . remember , all i ’ m using this for is potential incident recording . in that respect the s300 fits the bill . there ’ s some shortcomings but for $ 50 they are not significant . but i knocked off a star because the features that would have made it a 5 star rating would have been easy to implement for no extra cost. < br / > here ’ s the minor problems ranked in order of importance to me : < br / > 1 . from the menu , loop recording is limited to 1 min , 5 min or 10 min . i had hoped it would be an infinite loop . this is where card fills , then overwriting the old images . even a 10 minute loop may miss that critical moment that i hope never happens . i ’ ll just keep loop off then format the card when i recharge the battery. < br / > 2 . the motion detect start is way too sensitive . with the camera on , and my bike leaning against the wall it seems to be set off by a footstep . also it ’ s upside down . maybe for mounting it to the underside of a car mirror ? < br / > 3 . i know the battery is new , but my 45 minute commute consumed 75 % of the battery life . with display off . i keep a usb charger at my desk for electronics so not a big deal. < br / > 4 . i ’ m betting the camera ’ s not remotely waterproof or even water resistant . maybe i missed it in the accessory bag , but the usb charging port is completely exposed . the card slot and buttons have no visible gaskets . it may survive a light rain , but i ’ m packing a plastic baggie just in case. < br / > that ’ s about it . thanks for taking the time to read my review . if anything significant pops up during long term use , i ’ ll post it here.ting the camera ’ s not remotely waterproof or even water resistant . maybe i missed it in the accessory bag , but the usb charging port is completely exposed . the card slot and buttons have no visible gaskets . it may survive a light rain , but i ’ m packing a plastic baggie just in case. < br / > that ’ s about it . thanks for taking the time to read my review . if anything significant pops up during long term use , i ’ ll post it here .
__label__negative__ battery lasts 2 to 4 h ( no wifi ) . it gets extremely hot . not practical .
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ good experience
__label__positive__ works perfect with the smc takumar 50mm/1.4 . infinite focus is possible with this v.1 . chrome v.2 does not work with this lens in particular .
__label__negative__ update ! ok so i finally got batteries and charger on my own only to find the battery cover on the camera is broken ! ! there are no batteries , no charger , no strap , no usb , no video cables , no remote , etc ! it was advertised as having all these things several times in the description . therefore i ca n't even test the camera . description specifically states : & # 34 ; this package includes the camedia c-750 digital camera , 16 mb xd memory card , four ni-mh rechargeable batteries and charger , rm-2 wireless remote control , usb and a/v cables , wrist strap , warranty card , and cd-rom with camedia master imaging software and usb drivers for windows and mac. & # 34 ;
__label__positive__ & # 34 ; love & # 34 ; maybe not a strong enough word for this thing ... after lugging around a really heavy manfrotto aluminum version ... .
__label__positive__ works well .
__label__positive__ gift for my 9 yr old . good quality pics for a polaroid . she is very pleased .
__label__positive__ perfect for sony mirrrorless and the need to carry so many batteries
__label__positive__ a true artisan . thank you !
__label__positive__ the stands feel a little unstable but a good value .
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid:305f2e8803b50f1c749554d7dd698306 ] ] i do a lot of filming with the gopro hero3 . it 's a great camera , but often i get the buttons mixed up etc ... and it can be a little frustrating. < br / > < br / > i like the new sessions . it 's more compact and has better low-light shooting. < br / > < br / > great camera and worth the money .
__label__positive__ excellent quality , fits perfectly .
__label__positive__ shipping was fast i received it earlier than expected and i 'm very happy with the camera and accessories !
__label__positive__ i will buy more , love it ! ! !
__label__neutral__ there must be a reason these are on sale . the good news is that set up is not difficult but takes some time . the bad news is that the video produced is grainy black and white . you can change the resolution to 240dpi but i ca n't tell any difference . a friend of mine has a wireless system using battery powered cameras that he claims last six months . i wo n't be buying any more of these cameras for certain .
__label__positive__ very well made lens cap keepers . better than many others that i have tried that did not last the entire shoot . plus , not only well made but you get 5 , each individually packaged . great for storing extras in the camera bag !
__label__positive__ works great . provide your own casing/mounting and software ; works with any modern os without additional drivers due to following the & # 34 ; uvc & # 34 ; ( usb video class ) standard , i 've even used it with a chromebook . it has a noticeably wider field of view than your typical webcam . also , the circuit board is pretty small , compare to the size of the usb plug in the photos .
__label__positive__ awesome ! just get a cheap 1tb usb drive and you are good-to-go ! works perfectly !
__label__positive__ i bought this for a christmas present and found i needed it for a trip to nyc . this is the best thing ever . it was easily paired with my iphone and my nieces samsung . we had no problem fitting either phone into the caddy . the reach of the stick was long enough to take excellent group photos as well as special view 'outside ' the viewing platforms . i highly recommend this product. < br / > < br / > i will be purchasing 3 more today . one to replace the christmas present , and one for the niece and nephew who were with me .
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ i love my nikon d5200 the pictures come out very crisp and colorful . this was an expensive purchase for me , but i do n't regret it. < br / > i have used it more for pictures . i do n't often use the auto focus , but when i do it does a fantastic job of gauging distance and adjusting appropriately . the screen flips out with makes it easy to get that low to the ground angle or hold it up really high and just flipping out my screen to see ( when in doubt just whip it out ) . there is a jack for an external mic which is very important for a serious video shoot. < br / > < br / > my only complaints are < br / > -this can shoot 1080 at 30p or 60i , but not at 1080p < br / > -magic lantern is n't a thing for nikon < br / > < br / > it 's a great camera however for videos i would consider a canon because of magic lantern but for a smaller budget this is a real bang for your buck ! it 's very versatile and takes great pictures .
__label__neutral__ i do wish they would have told me it has an automatic shut off . that 's no problem , . i just could n't find how to shut it off until i went online and read the manual .
__label__positive__ excellent kit , i use all the accessories , great quality for the price ... only the rotary wrist mount bad quality and it broke it in the first use , but for the global price and all the accessories , it 's great purchase
__label__positive__ came in on time . a little heavier than i thought it would be , but fits perfectly in my backpack ( with pan head off ) . my other tripods are much heavier/longer and must be strapped to the out side . operates smoothly , is well built and great for travel .
__label__positive__ fit my needs perfectly . small , with a lot of capability .
__label__positive__ great price and fast delivery ! !
__label__positive__ nice compact camera with many features good for traveling . good range for all types of pictures .
__label__positive__ i put this on my e-m5 , and it really helps give a more stable grip ... adds just enough size to let my hand hold the camera more naturally .
__label__positive__ lots of mounts
__label__positive__ compact sony kit lens for the nex series that works very well - sharp enough .
__label__negative__ zippers gave out week one and bag is n't working out
__label__positive__ had this one before and i love it !
__label__positive__ i use these for my photography business . .. it 's a great deal
__label__negative__ was not up to the dimensions advertised and not adequate for my needs .
__label__positive__ got one just before leaving on a trip . love the collapsible build . like being able to just push it back instead of remove , turn around and screw back on . worked well .
__label__positive__ first it unfortunately could not eliminate the focus noise from my usm lens . it didn ’ t claim to , but i was hopeful since it claimed to & # 34 ; mechanical noise of cameras & # 34 ; . it did not ; i ’ m going to have to go off-camera microphone for that . i was using a 28-70 2.8 l. i did n't test with the new stm lenses. < br / > my only other complaint is that this is called an “ interview mic ” and is configured for on-camera use. < br / > this does not work well. < br / > at 6-8 feet or so the audio sounds sort of muffled and sort of “ underwater . it 's not horrible , but its not good either. < br / > the problem is that the mic needs to be a lot closer to the speaker to get good results ; a foot or so. < br / > to do this you ’ ll need a 3.5 extension cable , and a hot-shoe to microphone stand adapter , and a stand. < br / > in short this mic is pretty much useless on-camera as shown , but at the price , it ’ s not a bad mic at all. < br / > i ’ m using this with a canon d70 .
__label__positive__ great product . i used it on 2 computer monitors and my 50 & # 34 ; plasma screen tv and they look beautiful . there was no film or smearing like what i read about with similar products. < br / > the microfiber cloths worked great too . they did n't leave any fibers behind , whatsoever .
__label__positive__ since i had found the perfect travel backpack to carry my full frame dslr system and 13 & # 34 ; laptop ( lowepro protactic ) , i needed a smaller one for my fujifilm mirrorless system . i was at my local bb and came across the lowepro fastpack dslr video 150 aw backpack . this bag is very slim in design and from other bag experiences i immediately knew it would be the perfect travel companion for what i needed to carry. < br / > < br / > surprisingly , it holds my 13 & # 34 ; mbpro retina comfortably in the rear laptop compartment . i can place my x-t1 with 18-135mm lens in the main bottom camera compartment . my x100t fits nicely in the top compartment along with extra batteries , media cards , sunglasses , small wallet , etc . it comes with a small zippered bag that can hold cables and small accessories like my iphone charger and cable and my remote control for my camera . oh yeah , it will also store my tiny external flash that came with my x-t1. < br / > < br / > this backpack does not have a sternum strap . no worries . i found one here on amazon by bucklegear. < br / > < br / > this backpack is quite comfortable when fully loaded . great size and i like the slim design . stows nicely on the plane under the seat in front. < br / > < br / > so far , the best camera backpacks i own are from lowepro .
__label__positive__ with a little practice the wand works as well as the more expensive wands . also like the cleaning fluid better than visible dust with no residue . the sticky thing i 'm not sold on yet .
__label__neutral__ pictures from an & # 34 ; old fashioned & # 34 ; camera like this just do n't compare with the digital shots of today ... but i tried it again , as i had used one of these many years ago . i will just get a good quality digital camera that is useable under water for my next snorkel trip .
__label__negative__ there is no way to attach the gopro to the chest strap . i think you will need to have a case that houses the gopro and snaps into the chest start . i wish the description stated that .
__label__positive__ this is a great camera for an amateur photographer . love it !
__label__positive__ i ordered this jan of 2015 and it has worked perfectly since day one . looking back on it now though i should have got the model that charges both batteries simultaneously . while you wo n't be using that feature that often , it definitely is a blessing when you need it . overall i am satisfied with this purchase and would not hesitate to buy again ( the other model that is ) .
__label__positive__ good product , nice quality . compatible with logitech c920
__label__positive__ love this lens . bought it mostly for night photography . captured a milky way pic . i am amazed by the sharpness of the stars in the pic . ( of course there are post processing involved as well ) < br / > absolutely stunning to me to be honest. < br / > love the depth of field it creates. < br / > but i am yet to experiment more with lens. < br / > < br / > the only thing i am not so happy about is this lens is all manual. < br / > i hope i get used to it sooner when i am using the lens in the daytime .
__label__negative__ this pan/tilt head goes by the name of ebenk , king best and polaroid . make no mistake , these are the exact same things manufactured in china . i ordered one 7 years ago and , although flimsily made , it worked up until this year . i have now ordered 4 of them and every single one either did not work at all , or partially worked . one would pan up but not come down and was stuck . one would n't turn on with batteries installed or the ac adapter plugged in . one came with the plastic faceplate broken off and the last one would only pan 10 degrees left or right and would stop and not budge . you could hear the gears grinding . it was also missing the snap on camera attachment . do not buy these . to the sellers : stop selling these . this is sad because i got a lot of use out of my first one and now i 'll have to spend over $ 500 to get a wireless pan head .
__label__positive__ my 10 year old son loves this camera..camera features are great , the only problem i could not run the videos on his ipad..probably i need a program for that ... still need to figure out this issue ... but other than that for the price , a very good deal !
__label__positive__ awesome camera just what i expected . everything in the kit is high quality well except for the tripod . great extra batterie also .
__label__positive__ well made , comfortable on the wrist . detachable clip makes this even handier . love the design too. < br / > i 've also been using optech 's larger model wrist strap on my mirrorless fuji x-t1 on three trips , and their products are very well made and the most comfortable straps around .
__label__negative__ garbage ! fell apart as soon as i opened the box .
__label__positive__ fits the camera well . not much room for extras . maybe an extra battery and memory card. < br / > < br / > should pack well and protect camera .
__label__negative__ sharp picture & good audio , i ordered a 2nd camera to get a complete view of my driveway . pretty impressed w/this unit especially at this price . the 1st unit i received was defective but w/amazons great return policy that was only an annoyance . on day 9 i wake up to the color smear on the monitor , same reason i had to return the 1st unit . turned it off for a few min & problem cleared . starting to have my doubts .
__label__positive__ nice
__label__positive__ functions well , and superior product to most commercially available systems , at a fraction of the cost . i have a few simple software/firmware upgrade suggestions : improve the chime function so that when a chime zone rings the control unit announces the zone by name or else plays the recorded zone name ; this would enhance situational awareness/safety for security and safety with children , etc .
__label__positive__ fits my aw120 just fine .
__label__positive__ it does what it purports to do , is sturdy , and i could n't be happier . advice : make sure you use proper lighting , as with any green screen rig .
__label__negative__ not for vigorous movements . swivel base pops out of retaining unit too easily .
__label__positive__ lost the charger for my camera . perfect replacement and cheaper than ordering original !
__label__positive__ lightweight and sturdy ! the case it comes with fits it perfectly , but becomes useless if you add a ballhead or any other accessory .
__label__positive__ works great , but the picture may be misleading . it only comes with the 18 & # 34 ; , and not the set of 5 which is on the photo .
__label__negative__ hi , the quality is not good. < br / > after 3 times the screw was broken , my new flash has been dropped and he has had damage ! < br / > do n't buy this product !
__label__positive__ good price and good procuct
__label__negative__ does n't work for coolpix s3600 . you can even see that the contact points are different on the charger than they are on the batteries . the light comes on and it looks like it 's charging , but when i put the battery in the camera , nothing . would n't turn on . i bought this camera for my husband last christmas and it 's had very little use , so it 's not old , nor has it been mistreated . i charged the battery over night , so i do n't think that 's it either . right now i 'm shopping for another charger and hoping i can send this one back .
__label__positive__ good quality
__label__negative__ worked ok for a year and then died suddenly , now i have pay to ship it across the country to get an rma ... . fair product , bad company .
__label__negative__ no horizontal panning . view is a cone area below the device . limited view .
__label__positive__ the package arrived quickly.all the accessories work perfect with my go pro camera.i am very pleased and highly recommend .
__label__positive__ simple but very useful product . lot of improvement in image quality while using flash .
__label__positive__ i am very happy with this water sports package . the item i was most interested in was the snorkel piece . it makes for great pov footage while diving . the downside of course is that you ca n't use your actual snorkel while diving . the yellow piece is a buoy of sorts . it 's great in case you 're afraid of dropping the camera and having it sink to the bottom of the ocean . the yellow color makes it easier to spot ! the circular mount seems to be made to be attached to a surfboard or the bow of a boat or kayak . the kit also comes with two red foam kits . they can be attached to the back of your camera housing to make it buoyant . the kit also comes with 12 anti fog inserts ! any diver knows the struggle of having their camera fog during a dive ! < br / > < br / > overall , this is a wonderful and high quality product . i am very happy with it , and in the interest of full disclosure , i received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review .
__label__negative__ some small parts , specially for widescreen images do n't fit well ( two lenses together ) . i 'd prefer to pay a little more to a better quality product .
__label__positive__ i got this as a day bag for my canon rebel sl1 a few months ago and i have found it to be very useful . it 's gone on quite a number of day trips with me so far and has held up well . i use it when i want to travel light and just take the camera with kit lens with maybe another small lens like the 50mm lens or the fish eye . i can also put a polarizing or other filter , some cleaning supplies , spare battery and spare card in the two side pockets .
__label__positive__ i 've noticed that some of these units have a 'latching ' time of 4 minutes , and others are much quicker . i 'm not sure how you can change this , but it has a real-world effect on z-wave/security/programmatic operation of the unit .
__label__positive__ top !
__label__positive__ you gottsa have one of these .
__label__negative__ the specific features of the product were that what i received was not compatible with the cameras the ad claimed it was compatible with .
__label__positive__ powers my 7 & # 34 ; lilliput monitor from my red brick . works great .
__label__positive__ great bundle . i 've used most of the mounts from this and have had zero issues .
__label__positive__ perfect ! fits great and looks great . shipping was fast , and i live in pennsylvania
__label__positive__ works great ! only surprise was that the system has to be hooked up to a computer in order to transmit to your phone . it makes sense , we were just unaware of that when we purchased the product .
__label__positive__ good value and easy to set up
__label__positive__ wish more quality clear camara
__label__neutral__ good !
__label__negative__ i opted to spend a little more money for this grip . i am getting an error message on the camera sporadically and the left battery does not stay locked in place in the grip ( both are oem batteries ) . i have not contacted anyone about returning it , but it looks like that will have to be my option .
__label__negative__ doa returned .
__label__positive__ easy to use and takes great pictures
__label__positive__ the camera was exactly as promised and i have loved it immensely . it was a good price for the camera , and it has been rewarding to me .
__label__positive__ came on time and it 's what i expected ! !
__label__positive__ great battery grip , fits my gh4 perfectly . only way i could think of improving this product is a meter showing time until dead so you know about how long you have until you need to get a new battery , however i 'm not even sure if that 's possible so in the meantime all i have to say is great grip
__label__positive__ great production gear bag . i got it cheap so , it 's five stars for sure . i 'd likely never pay full price or the porta brace price . but the shoulder strap is a nice addition . more dividers on the inside would have been good . but overall you ca n't beat the quality .
__label__positive__ just what i was looking for
__label__positive__ great product . works as advertised .
__label__positive__ ar004214 service man did an excellent job fo getting this camera to work properly . it works great over the internet using my dlink website .
__label__positive__ light duty . great product .
__label__positive__ great seller - delivered as promised !
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ its an amazing product evryone should have one
__label__positive__ i love this case for my camera . we took it on our honeymoon with us and i was so pleased that i was able to take it with me snorkeling . it can be tough to figure out how to hit the buttons through the plastic but it is a great inexpensive way to get your regular camera into a waterproof one without spending hundreds of dollars .
__label__positive__ inexpensive yet quality workmanship .
__label__neutral__ resolution is good if the camera does not move - takes a while to fill in detail . wifi is very difficult to set up . i use dhcp reservation but the ip does not renew properly without multiple power cycles .
__label__positive__ just received this today and had it installed and working 95 % in about an hour . 1 of the 65 ' cables was damaged and could not be used at all so i only have a 3 camera system instead of 4 . emailed the company and hope they send me another 65 ' cable to replace the damaged one . great day video , great night video from the 3 installed cameras as well .
__label__positive__ makes a huge difference
__label__negative__ it 's a cute case but it 's missing a hook for the strap so you ca n't actually use the strap . would love if a seller would contact me about replacing it
__label__positive__ great film for college shooting
__label__positive__ love this camera ! got great shots of yellowstone & glacier national parks along with their wildlife .
__label__negative__ not that much good quality video
__label__negative__ charged both batteries . put one in my go pro hero 3 silver . did n't use it . went to charge the battery for the next use and i noticed that it had bulged in the center on both sides . is useless now . completely dissappointed with this product .
__label__positive__ i am a newbie when it comes to photography but this pentax remote seems to work great . its functional and reliable . i could n't ask for more . value is very good for the price and functionality .
__label__positive__ this item arrived timely and was reasonably priced .
__label__positive__ works exactly as i wanted . slave flash . i 'm happy & price was astonishing .
__label__positive__ pretty good
__label__positive__ great little camera for me . easy to use and takes good pictures .
__label__positive__ good product .
__label__positive__ works as advertised .
__label__neutral__ i went back and forth for years over this grip and finally made the leap. < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > -battery life < br / > -added stability with weight < br / > -extended gripping surface for landscape holding in addition to portrait grip < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > -the buttons on the grip are not in the same familiar areas in comparison with your forefinger and thumb , so you have to reorient your fingers to r-reach them . i ended up struggling just to change focus points on the fly , and the joystick is uncomfortably low in comparison to what i was use to on the camera . also , i still found myself extending my thumb to change settings with the rear control ring on the camera since there is n't one on the grip. < br / > -the grip itself is too wide , even for larger hands such as mine , and ended up feeling somewhat cumbersome to hold throughout my 16 hour wedding shoot .
__label__positive__ love it !
__label__positive__ this is the most consistent and compatible of my ip cameras and has the best installation software
__label__negative__ very weak does not support anything you get what you pay for
__label__neutral__ they have chenged the product to make it cheaper looking . does n't match my other 4 . like the ethernet jack is all plastic . they removed some silver trim , mount is smaller . camera still the same , just divas pointed they cheapened the look .
__label__positive__ these camera bags are fairly versatile and have been holding up well with extended use . the interior honestly feels softer than micro fiber and the handles on the side have been going strong wrapped on my leather belt for a bit now . the carbiner is only plastic , so be careful with your surrounding if you 're swinging the bags a lot . overall , i am very happy with these cheap bags . they saddle and hold all my lens perfectly . my 24-105mm is a little on the big/small side pending on the case used , but nothing major . definitely recommend as a cheap alternative to more costly products .
__label__positive__ very good inexpensive camera
__label__negative__ inadequate instructions ; not easy set up - three days , no help from downloaded user manual - gave up and returned . has to use picture on box just to assemble unit . have two computers and two iphones on wireless router with no problems . no way to tell if unit is actually on and receiving power .
__label__positive__ it is very easy to put together . you do not need any instructions to put it together . it took me 10 minutes to put all the kit up and i was shooting pictures and videos within a few minutes . the only negative aspect of this is that it does n't have a caring case . it is not big at all but you will need a bag with some sort of padding to be able to transport it safely . i will use a foot locker to put it it . i 'm very pleased with the quality. < br / > the backdrop needs to be iron or you can use your steam cycle on your dryer ( if you have one ) to be able to prevent wrinkles . backdrop is small but for quinceaneras or sweet sixteen girls is more than enough . they really like to pose close to the lights. < br / > it looks very professional and it work fairly good .
__label__negative__ i purchsed two of these batteries one on 8/30/15 and another on 727/15 and originally gave them 4 star ratings . as of this date both give off a very musty oder after charging and during active use in both of my fuji cameras . i can actually smell the cameras when getting near my face to focus . the smell is very strong when charging either battery . fuji batteries are odor free . i would call stk but i do want to risk my over $ 2000 valued cameras using any replacement stk battery and will just trash these stk 's a slow learner i may be , as i purchased these based on the reviews . cheap is cheap not a bargin ! i have had success with wasabi batteries in my previous nikon and my present fuji 's , which i used as back-up batteries . in the future i may purchase wasabi again but probably just pay the price for the original camera manf batteries . stk junk - i wish amazon had a zero rating .
__label__positive__ the most fun and useful & # 34 ; toy & # 34 ; i 've ever purchased
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ works fine and gives me another option as far as wide angle .
__label__positive__ not as sturdy as my original , but gets the job done and has the option of car charging and charging in europe . it seems to charge faster than my old one .
__label__positive__ it does what it claims . i was able to keep my batteries charged using this and a folding solar panel .
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid : cf668ecaf63602505e49f06d7c2feded ] ] i am giving this 4 star rating considering the price range ( $ 60 on amazon ) . there are cheaper action cameras out there , ( ~ $ 25-40 ) and more expensive ( ~ $ 100-500+ ) . for $ 60 , i expected a camera that took adequate video , was actually waterproof , simple to use , decent battery life , and was not going to break after a few uses . the s200 does basically that. < br / > < br / > the camera itself is not the highest quality in terms of construction , and would likely not hold up long to rugged abuse . in the waterproof case , it is protected quite well and would hold up pretty well. < br / > < br / > it is mostly simple to use . the touch sceen is mostly fine , but not very sensitive , and somewhat difficult to navigate , even taking the small size into consideration . also the on screen navigation is not the most intuitive , but i was able to figure it out mostly just by playing around with it for a while. < br / > < br / > as for image quality , it is not what i had hoped for considering all the claims made about megapixels and 1080p etc . however it was also not disappointing . probably what i should have expected for $ 60 . if you need/want the highest image quality , buy a $ 400 camera . ( you can see my sample video for image quality on 1080p , including underwater ) the sound is average maybe , although in the waterproof case , not good , but that should be expected. < br / > battery life is not as good as the claims , but should last for at least an hour . that is about what i got recording at 1080 , which is good enough . considering the battery life , a smaller micro sd card is sufficient . it will take 32g , but i got a 16g which will record about 2 hours at 1080 , exceeding a single battery charge , so for me it is unnecessary to use a bigger card. < br / > < br / > the quantity of accessories is very nice . you can strap the camera to a helmet , bicycle , kayak , and a number of other things i 'm sure . i got this mostly for recording fishing trips , and it has been sufficient , consideringwhat i was willing to pay . i am not willing to pay $ 400 , so i am satisfied with the s200. < br / > < br / > for $ 60 , i would not say this camera is a \\ '' great\\ '' deal , but it is worth about what it costs ... suprise , suprise !
__label__positive__ an excellent choice to upgrade my dx40 to !
__label__neutral__ these are decent lights but the 198c puts out 1/2 of the light of the 198 because only 1/2 of the leds are of either color and it just switches between them with the rheostat . while the build quality is slightly better , other similar lights cost much less with the same output as the 198 and twice the 198c
__label__positive__ very light , feels kinda cheap but overall very good tripod . ca n't beat the price , highly recommended .
__label__negative__ it is totally enclosed housing . it doesn´t allows cables plugs , like showed the picture .
__label__neutral__ would have gotten 4 stars if it were made in japan like the lens itself ! ! ! made in china and still charge $ 25 u.s . ..pathetic ! !
__label__positive__ osd anything on a camera this cheap should n't be passed up ... i 've seen alot of 800 , 1000 , even 1200 tvl cameras for under $ 20 ... they all look like crap in 1080p @ 48 & # 34 ; ... this does n't look bad even thou you'ld expect it to
__label__positive__ item delivered on time , and works perfectly . glad to have the keeper leash so i do n't lose anymore ... ... ..
__label__positive__ great easy setup . we have 2 dogs that like to get into things while we are away from home so having a camera to check in was something on the list of things to do . we did n't want to purchase a dvr setup with multiple cameras just to monitor the dogs but we also wanted a way to communicate with them in the event that we caught them doing things they should n't . this camera fit the bill perfectly . it was setup in less than 15 minutes and tested the same day . we left the house and watched the dogs . when one started to do something , we spoke to him and his reaction was priceless . needless to say , this camera is worth having .
__label__positive__ very happy with my camera package ! the only thing that bummed me was i received the case with the zipper jumped off track and does n't close in the corners . but that 's why the front clips are great ! very happy .
__label__positive__ works perfectly . and i love being able to move it and see it from my cell phone .
__label__positive__ worked perfectly , no complaints . i 'm about to buy more
__label__positive__ i love this lense
__label__positive__ wonderful sturdy quality ; very pleased with this purchase .
__label__positive__ i love this camera . if you are looking to step into a dslr and are not already a pro this is the place to start .
__label__positive__ fit perfectly -- allowed me to use my camcorder without the battery .
__label__positive__ 5 star - nothing more to say .
__label__positive__ nice lens .
__label__positive__ i love the case . i am glad that i can finally protect my camera . it 's really a cute looking case .
__label__positive__ i purchased this becuase of online reviews from youtube . the light kit is built solid . the controls are separate from the head which is great if it it 8 ' in the air you have full digital dimming in 1 % increments . i am impressed with the color rendering from 3k-5.5k . i got to save up to buy another one . there is a remote which you can use for grouping more than one fixture . shipping was 3 days which was faster than expected .
__label__positive__ still working after all this time ; and doing it well
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ unbelievably well machined for pieces at this price .
__label__positive__ this thing is great ! it makes it so easy for me to take my camera places without having to bring my whole giant bag . it fits my canon t5i perfectly .
__label__negative__ no comment .
__label__neutral__ i am very happy with it , but i do n't believe i knew that there were 16 hook-up entrees in the back . i only needed 8 . it is now 6 months later & the damn thing no longer works & amazon will not replace it , but they did say they will refund my money . so i do not recommend buying anything that you would normally want to work for longer than 6 months .
__label__positive__ works great very happy
__label__positive__ work great ! other members in our group were envious and wanted one !
__label__positive__ great product . great price . smooth transaction .
__label__positive__ this camera has more than everything you will need . the tripod is a little weak , and the bag a little small ... but the lens options and the wireless mic make this an ideal camera for quick filming and interview pieces .
__label__positive__ a nice size card that fits in my gadget bag nicely .
__label__positive__ works great . thicker than i thought it would be .
__label__positive__ i love these cameras . the details of the images are excellent . what i love the most is the night vision , it is so clear . initial set up is easy , but i was having trouble to see the cameras when i was at work . i bought the mobilinc app , which is $ 9.99 as recommended by sharx , but i still could n't see the images from work . so i contacted mobilinc for support and they were very nice to reply and tell me what i needed to do . then , i went back to the sharx instruction manual and followed the instructions on how to set it up on my apple airport . now i can see my cameras from anywhere. < br / > love them . i still have to set up motion sensor and emails , but i will do it later. < br / > the only thing is that i think sharx should write the instructions with more colors , so it is easier to follow them . another thing is that if electricity goes off , the cameras wo n't work because they do not use batteries . they need to work on that . but i do have a home security account so no problem. < br / > as soon as i can , i will buy the sharx outdoor cameras .
__label__positive__ a little bit too small , but for the price + prime shipping , nothing can beat it. < br / > what you see on photos is what you get .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ with a keystone grid , excellent keystones for installing into an 'old construction ' gang box .
__label__neutral__ everything was nice , but it did n't bring stickers
__label__positive__ even though i rarely ever use it in the new mexico sunlight , it has done it 's job
__label__positive__ worked perfectly as expected .
__label__negative__ film takes toooooooooooo long to develop .
__label__positive__ great
__label__neutral__ it does the trick for a lot of equipment at a low cost
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ is good price
__label__neutral__ basic ip camera . goes offline once in a while .
__label__positive__ i used this case every day for 7 weeks while on a trip through europe . i would not have wanted to travel without it . the hand held strap was worth the cost of the case alone . the case protected my camera and i found it very easy to use throughout the day and night of our travels .
__label__positive__ my sister and i used to love having photo shoots as kids with a polaroid camera . i bought this on a whim after feeling a bit nostalgic for my younger days . i 'm very pleased with the camera . it takes really cool photos . i 've been having fun snapping pictures of my new baby boy. < br / > < br / > i highly recommend it .
__label__positive__ seems to charge 9v lithium ion batteries just fine ... . but please see my review on the ebl 9v rechargeable lithium ion batteries .
__label__positive__ great photos
__label__negative__ not at all what is advertised . do n't buy it ! < br / > this product ships internationally from china and now amazon is telling me it can not be returned for that reason . there were a host of problems with this device . read below and draw your own conclusions : < br / > 1 ) instructions come on a cd mini disk . you will need a cd drive that has a tray that slides in and out to use this disc . if you have a mac or other type cs device that requires you to push the cd into a slot , you ca n't use this disc . you will need a disc adaptor ( another expense ) , or hopefully know someone with a computer that has an ejectable tray. < br / > 2 ) the amazon ad says this item also functions as a real usb recharging device . it does not ! no recharging cord comes with this unit and even if it did , there is no place to plug it in . it does not function as a charger. < br / > 3 ) the amazon ad says this device works on normal electricity or battery . it does not work on a battery . there is no battery in this unit. < br / > i can not endorse this item at all and in fact i would warn potential buyers to avoid this device all together . the ad description including the responses to the questions posted under the product description are misleading and very inaccurate . i am surprise amazon is allowing this seller on their site . i have a request in to amazon customer service requesting their assistance with a return since the item was misrepresented to me . i am waiting to hear back .
__label__negative__ crap
__label__positive__ excellent
__label__positive__ pros : < br / > -takes picture very fast < br / > -best quality of any camera i 've ever seen < br / > -flash extremely powerful when used < br / > -flash easy to control when needed < br / > -a good grip allow you to take pictures with one hand. < br / > -decent zoom < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > -no date/time stamp < br / > -changing the lenses can be a bit troublesome since it takes so much time and you have to make sure no dust goes inside the camera. < br / > < br / > obviously the pros outweigh the cons , and especially since the cone are minor , it does n't matter much . if you 're not a zoom fanatic i would recommend buying just the camera itself without the 55-210mm lens .
__label__positive__ i was researching for a while for a good camera that could handle our family activities , to be waterproof , small size for my children to handle without being worried of damaging the camera and high quality resolution . when i order go pro plus lcd , from its size i was little skeptical about its quality but form the moment i used it i loved it . the reason i chooses go pro plus lcd was it has wifi , touch screen compare to it basic model for only $ 100 difference . there are tons of video in youtube to teach you how to use it and what is the best accessories bundle that 's comes with it. < br / > but here is my tip the most you need is the handheld monopod and floating handle grip . if you like to ski and bicycling you can go ahead and order the head and chest mount straps too .
__label__negative__ i well tey it '' s not working . light still on nothing off
__label__positive__ convenient , does what it is supposed to do no problems
__label__negative__ the plastic cracked while putting it on my iphone5 the first try , so i had to return it . i did try a few shots and they were n't anything special .
__label__positive__ product is self explainable. < br / > just make sure you measure before ordering this way you do n't have to roll up 30 feet of wire .
__label__positive__ very nicely made with a nice touch of flair . would recommend
__label__positive__ good quality good price ...
__label__negative__ this product came without any software the disk came empty , there is no way to configure or connect with the camera .
__label__positive__ love , love , love my new fujikams ! they were easy to set up and the end product is even better than what i expected ! i can rotate the camera , zoom in or out , and have a discussion all from my smart phone .
__label__positive__ this charger fit my battery and charged it quickly . it was shipped quickly . i am happy with my purchase .
__label__positive__ took it snowboarding in colorado . worked perfectly .
__label__negative__ a junk product . this diffuser is too small for my canon 580ex ii flash . it will also not fit on my other canon flashes . it is made for a much smaller flash . do not order because you will probably not get a diffuser that properly fits your flash .
__label__positive__ heavy duty and they work great .
__label__positive__ daughter looooves this camera . only wish the film was cheaper : o )
__label__positive__ great product for the price . short of the nikon name , it performs as expected . why pay more for the same thing ?
__label__positive__ very delicate , but works well .
__label__positive__ great photos . just wish it were cheaper . i guess if you are a pro photographer then you can definitely justify investing in this product . this would be true in most cases . the red gel is actually more of a pink fyi . snoot is really hard to get on . dvd is pointless !
__label__positive__ the gopro floaty backdoor worked better than expected , for a minimal investment , you 'll make sure your camera does n't sink to the bottom of the sea . i bought it for my vacation to bermuda and it had enough buoyancy to keep my gopro hero 3 and a selfie stick afloat . if you plan on using your gopro anywhere near water , you owe it to yourself to make this purchase .
__label__positive__ user friendly , crisp imagery , good battery life .
__label__negative__ very poor quality - would never purchase this again ! < br / > < br / > after receiving it i immediately starting charging one of the batteries . with nearly 30 hours on charge the battery read 0 % charged , 0.0 volts . i even checked this on a volt meter and also got 0.0 volts. < br / > < br / > i decided that battery might be defective so i put the other battery on charge . after 3 solid days it never got above 80 % charged and 7.3 volts . not sure if it 's the charger or the battery but i do n't have any confidence in this manufacturer 's equipment. < br / > < br / > the box has a customer service number but i decided not to bother since i do n't trust this equipment for professional production or broadcast use - where i intend to use it . i 've now ordered a much more expensive and higher quality charger and batteries . like they say , & # 34 ; buy the best , cry only once. & # 34 ; this is exactly why ... < br / > < br / > additionally : < br / > the charger seems nice enough but i 'm not sure it is built with robust circuitry to charge these high capacity batteries . since i do n't have any other batteries to try on it i ca n't say for sure . but i did find it annoying that the battery plate ( the adapter plate on the top of the charger for the specific type of battery to charge ) slides off so easily . every time you remove a batter the plate come off with it . there is no lock/clip to keep it in place . the only fix is to apply a strip of tape to the sides or to glue it . very annoying .
__label__negative__ this is the worst tripod ever ! ! ! i wanted a light weight tripod for my iphone ! and on the first day the screws thread to adjust the cameras angle stopped working . the screw is too small there for the screw ca n't hold the camera in place ! ! ! then i had it out side and i was filming and i accidentally bumped it and a leg broke ! ! ! so easily it just broke in half ! now i have anything but a tripod it ca n't hold my phone in an angel i would like and it had a broken leg ! ! do n't waist your time or money ! ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ no problems with product and/or delivery . works with camera as described .
__label__positive__ works really well with my legacy canon lenses
__label__positive__ fixed my camera connection problem . great product .
__label__positive__ happy with the product , does what i intended it to do ! love that you can string the cap to camera for easy impromptu photos !
__label__positive__ this product has been working perfectly for over a year . and it was a one owner when i bought it back then . video is always good . i wish it had a provision for an external mic , though .
__label__positive__ product was as advertised .
__label__negative__ piece of crap . battery works for the camera , but the charger does n't fit the batteries ... so much for high quality .
__label__positive__ rugged . have used it to film out on the field , and by field , i mean with the army while they deploy m777 howitzers . dust . vibrations . it does n't matter . tough . yeah , the paint may have chipped , but who cares ? it looks cool !
__label__positive__ i looked at the tripod mount kit at retail stores and they were going for $ 10 . all i needed was this piece so i can mount my gopro on to my dslr and mount my gopro onto my mini tripod . so glad they have this piece alone . not much to say since it 's so cheap and it does what it does .
__label__positive__ i am totally happy i went ahead and bought the f version with the screen and flash memory . love this
__label__positive__ perfect for sage keeping and easy transport
__label__positive__ good buy . on time and a expected .
__label__positive__ item as described and arrived quickly .
__label__positive__ thank you : ) )
__label__positive__ if you want to store some small items and keep them from getting crushed . this would be perfect . make sure you have a good understanding of the sizes before you order . this case is roomy enough for your iphone and a few other items .
__label__positive__ love the ease of use . better than an instant camera , i can use all the bells and whistles on my phone !
__label__positive__ why waste $ on go pro ?
__label__positive__ what can i say ? it 's a pelican case . i keep my electronic two-channel wireless bbq thermometer and probes in it . the yellow case color distinguishes it from my other pelican equipment cases . these things are almost indestructible !
__label__positive__ i love the retro vibe that this case gives to my recently purchased fujifilm x30 . the maker included a nice little wrist band as a gift which is greatly appreciated . the case fits beautifully and it can even fit inside the padded bag that came with my camera . i expected this item to take much longer to arrive and was happily surprised when it arrived on the quicker side of estimated delivery . my one complaint is that the quality of the leather seemed to be lacking a bit , but overall , i am extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend it to a friend without hesitation .
__label__positive__ the dividers in the bag can be rearranged since they connect with velcro which i can could be useful but i personally would have preferred fixed pockets . there is also logo on the top center that is a yellow & # 34 ; x & # 34 ; and on the side of it says & # 34 ; it & # 34 ; which is n't shown in the picture so heads up on that . the strap goes from right shoulder to left hip , which seems kinda funny to me
__label__positive__ works well with my all canon lens , slow with autofocus , do n't work with my tamron 28-75 2.8 in autofocus , but all of them work fine in manual focus .
__label__neutral__ i 've used this a handful of times on my dog . at first , it was just on walks to test it out . it worked great and the video was hilarious . when i took it out on some hiking trails and longer walks , i discovered the straps loosen and the harness will slide off to the side . my dog is also white and the black dye rubbed off on her , i did n't care much because she has short hair and bath time is n't too tedious . i will continue to use the harness , i just would not recommend allowing your dog out of sight or in water in the event the harness falls off .
__label__positive__ received the product timely , just as expected and in condition as expected . thank you !
__label__positive__ so far - works great . have only taken a few pictures - and they are good .
__label__positive__ good case , works great for sound suppressors , half the cost of a pelican . only gave four stars because there is no way to lock it .
__label__positive__ great resolution and easy to use ! definitely would buy again !
__label__positive__ this is another camera replacement camera for my system , so far this has been the best of the lot . i 've replaced six cameras within a three year period and this one seems to be holding up best . the mounting bracket is a little cheesy but does hold the camera in place and at times the picture can be a little on the green side mostly this happens when it is about to shift from day to night .
__label__positive__ this is the only one i have found that fits very pleased
__label__positive__ good wireless camera system . a little bit of interference based on distance .
__label__negative__ says on the box it is firmware revision 5.3.0 . turns out 5.2.5 is installed . had a couple of problems with fps settings . in order to get it to work with zoneminder cctv software it was suggested to upgrade the firmware . which i did . upload works perfectly . only the camera wo n't boot again . if you have a lot of time to fiddle with it , yes it may be a very good camera . if you just want something that works you may want to buy something else .
__label__neutral__ it worked as we have hoped- waterproof . you need to stay still a little longer when you take the picture ... , the flash light takes a little longer than other cameras if you need it for picture taking .
__label__positive__ the tripod has done its job well .
__label__positive__ the mounts provided with the camera are somewhat useful in most cases , but difficult to adapt for non-typical applications . camera works well , and very good quality video .
__label__positive__ i love it
__label__positive__ does its job just as expected , great value
__label__positive__ bought lens for portraits , will be a workhorse in the studio and on location. < br / > others indicated white boxes may be gray market lenses , this lens came in a sealed nikon box , i registered with www.nikonusa.com by serial number without issue . built nice , provides a bright viewfinder for the f4 , used it the same day i got it for some sports photos love the 24mm -120mm as one lens for full frame images .
__label__neutral__ decent camera ... .cloudy underwater pics
__label__positive__ wish i would of got the 8 camera unit other then that amazing
__label__positive__ i really like the large size of these cloths ( 12x12 . ) it makes the task of cleaning my eyeglass lenses a breeze . thanks for a great product .
__label__positive__ i 'm so happy with my purchase ! ! prefect condition and looks awesome ! !
__label__negative__ so after 5 crashes due to massive oscillation during decents i searched the internet for why . apparently these cf props are too stiff and literally blow the air out from under the copter during decents . that means no air to support the copter causing oscillatons and loss of control . there are work arounds such as flying down in a large spiraling path to avoid prop washout but the real solution is to use the more flexible factory props .
__label__negative__ did not work at all . i 'd plug in and it fit fine but then it did n't work . it was like there was something blocking communication between the cord and my smartphone .
__label__positive__ great drone . practice a lot especially in the open field to avoid hitting objects . i been flying this now even with trees around as i am now use to the controls . no need to compete with 3dr solo because of the cable , follow me and orbit features ... .with a lot of practice you can achieve that without those fancy features plus those features are software enabled so there are some glitches might occur that will enable the drone to act differently . i do orbit and selfie manually with this drone ... great buy and hoping it will last long ...
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ very good quality , big upgrade in terms of design from the previous .
__label__positive__ am very pleased with the initial setup . easy to figure out without instructions . it appears to be & # 34 ; as advertised & # 34 ; and plan to put it through its paces this weekend as i shoot large-group photos with my nikon dslr at two reunions . nice price , excellent product , and prompt delivery ! amazon scores again with me .
__label__positive__ heavy duty , great suction . definitely overkill for my gopro . will not pop off of clean surface . awesome dependable mount .
__label__negative__ you have to purchase d-link products to make this camera work without going insane with the workarounds otherwise. < br / > < br / > update - sept , 2017 : < br / > this camera is absolute trash < br / > - always drops out of connection when viewing from phone ( even from same network at home ) . < br / > - day mode is now blurry as all heck and i can not see anything , i 've manually switched to night mode .
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ efficient , thanks
__label__positive__ i 've had this camera for almost a year now and it 's worked great . at first , when i would shoot in night mode outside , everything played back was dark and a little grainy . even with a strong ir light ! ! i finally adjusted the exposure value to +2.0 ( ev for short ) and the recordings are nice and bright now . the full spectrum mode during the day shoots really nice also and i use this mode at night now with a strong ir light . the onboard ir light is not that strong so you will need to get an external light . the battery time is around four hours which is not bad . but a couple extra np-120 batteries and you can easily do an all night investigation . the camera records in avi , so if you want it in mp4 you will need some sort of conversion program . for the money you ca n't go wrong with this camera . i do recommend it .
__label__positive__ easy point and shoot , quality product . gone are the days when i photographed with all nikon film equipment . easy to slip in your pocket and with a 32 gig memory stick you can take a years worth of pics .
__label__positive__ for the price , i love my camera . great zoom and great pictures ! highly recommended !
__label__positive__ the plastic storage box in which the product was shipped was broken upon receipt . a piece was missing and was not in the cardboard box over packaging , so i assume that it was picked and shipped that way . the instruction sheet did not mention that a piece of paper had been jammed beneath the li-ion battery to keep it from accidentally discharging . i had to disassemble the flashlight to determine why it would n't work . not a big thing , but clearer instructions would have been nice . the light is bright , but the beam is not adjustable . the & # 34 ; stun gun & # 34 ; function seems to work , at least there is an ominous sparking and crackling when the switch is moved to the full forward position and the small button just below the charging port is pushed .
__label__positive__ works as advertised . will allow having filters mounted .
__label__positive__ perfect . no problems at all .
__label__positive__ as advertised . timely delivery ,
__label__neutral__ it was late but that 's my only real issue with it . i would have liked it if it came with a fur more extra screws but for the price it 's okay .
__label__positive__ awesome it works excellent
__label__positive__ i was very happy to get a cord for my camera for such a low price ... . and it works 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
__label__neutral__ got this camera for a trip to cancun . underwater capabilities are ok , with no leaks . used it to take pictures in cenotes , swimming pool , beach , water conditions . general purpose use in daylight and low-light conditions were so-so . my iphone 6 took better pictures . the panoramic mode was pretty much useless . the camera kept failing to take a complete picture as even the slightest deviation from a straight-line panoramic sweep would cause the camera to abort the take . picture quality is not that good for a dedicated point and shoot at this price range . if you are looking for a regular use point and shoot camera without a need for taking underwater or water-related pictures , look elsewhere for a better solution .
__label__positive__ very good binoculars to look at wild life .
__label__positive__ whale watching in alaska it was handy to have the zoom feature . image was pretty steady even without a tripod .
__label__positive__ i was able to use many of the accessories with my gopro hero 4 silver . my main concern so far was the monopod . it was working fine the first time i used it . then it just kept turning as if it could n't support the weight of the gopro . i hope it 's the only thing that 's going to go wrong .
__label__neutral__ items are fine but the packing was very very poor .
__label__negative__ worked for 3 sessions then wo n't stay charged and wo n't scroll through menu . do n't get this ! ! !
__label__negative__ would have bought if it was still $ 615 . lost a customer due to a companie 's greed 👎
__label__positive__ goo for the application . clear picture and you can identify person within 20 feet of the camera .
__label__positive__ i really like this bag .
__label__positive__ perfect fit !
__label__positive__ excellent .
__label__positive__ ok
__label__positive__ pretty good , but almost lost it when it came off while scanning my attic and caught a rafter . i am disabled [ a cripple in politically incorrect terms ] so i never get to peek in the attic . bought this to help save the money to have a handy person go up and take pics . now , i have little choice since , at 66 , i am one of the youngest here in sun city center , florida . as a true selfie stick it would probably hold a cell phone pretty safely , but i would plug in the shutter release cord to be safe . that was the only thing that saved me , or at least , my phone .
__label__negative__ need clearer instructions on how to use , record any additional items needed etc .
__label__positive__ lightweight , functional . i am very pleased with this product and its reasonable cost .
__label__neutral__ the wolverine converter works and i suppose for the price you might say it works well . however paper bound slides ( and most of the old ones are ) are difficult to feed through it . feeding bare photo film through it is simply put a struggle and a pita . it is much quicker that other methods i have tried however . in other words i 'm not overjoyed with it but i still think it 's worth what i paid for it just to finally get all my 135 slides converted to digital format .
__label__negative__ right out or the box , one of the rods was bent altering the shape of the modifier . tried to straighten it out but now i 'm afraid it will break . did n't cost much so i 'm not gon na bother returning it , but i sure wo n't buy another .
__label__positive__ awsome camcorder for the price , easy to use and much smaller than expected , great battery life and well worth buying extra batterys for longer use . if your also gon na take alot of pics with it i found its best to buy a good hd card for good clear pics .
__label__positive__ works great ! !
__label__neutral__ smaller than i thought it would be . good thing the lens strap is elastic . does the job though .
__label__positive__ bought this bag to hold my nikon d3300 . it is well made , but a little snug . if it were slightly larger i would have given it a full 5 stars .
__label__neutral__ it 's good for kids , but do n't expect too much . if you want to see more details of something , do n't buy this kind of microscope .
__label__positive__ bought for my 12 year old grandson . he loves using it when he is riding his bike .
__label__negative__ the pictures were horrible . i did n't like how there was n't a flash . and it did n't com with a sd card . i did n't like it .
__label__positive__ this is a sturdy little bracket . its just right for a smaller camera & an add on attachment . it folds up & fits in your camera bag .
__label__positive__ i bought one of these for my wife when we were going to europe . she fell in love with the telephoto lens and i fell in love with the quality of the images . bought one for myself when we came back to the states .
__label__positive__ i bought this for my business because i needed to set up a cctv camera. < br / > < br / > in terms of hardware build quality , i am completely satisfied and impressed . the motor for camera movement is quiet and smooth and it links up to wifi reliably . compared to other cams in the same price range ( many feel cheaper and fragile ) , this has really good build quality . you are getting great bang for your buck. < br / > < br / > the video quality is very good 720p and this basically does everything you need it to do with not much fuss. < br / > < br / > there is only one reason i gave it 4 stars and it has to do with the k view app software . if you want to control the camera in different directions , you have to be in zoomed in mode . this has to be tweaked . other than that , everything is good. < br / > < br / > overall a ++++ < br / > < br / > edit : 08/16/15 - i emailed the company about the camera having to be in zoomed in on the app to control the camera direction . they were quick to respond and told me they are working on an app update and will be pushing it out shortly . once they fix that , i can give this 5 stars because the hardware is excellent .
__label__negative__ - the chain can not go into the hole at the top of the device because it 's too-big < br / > < br / > - each time i would power-it up , it would flash a few times and go off in a just a couple seconds < br / > < br / > - it 's not the worst-looking , but it 's more of a 'goth ' type cross and -- on me -- it would just look too-unusual/out of place ; it 's pretty-thick < br / > < br / > - it has trouble getting recognized by the computer ; when it is , you can not look at any files on it and it is unable to be reformatted < br / > < br / > - while charging ( apparently ) , it gets really hot < br / > < br / > - there 's a popular , light '808 car keys ' camcorder that i saw some videos of ; it was of interest that a person spoke of having a model with built-in memory that would just fail -- and to him , it was a memory issue ; after taking a chance with one that took a memory-card , it was fine -- - and i suspect that there 's such a problem with this ; however , there is no version that takes a memory card < br / > < br / > - i got a refund , fortunately ; do n't waste your time trying to get one that works ; i ca n't say that all of these will be a waste , but i 'm not taking a chance with another
__label__positive__ great
__label__neutral__ good product
__label__positive__ great camera . i took mine for a swim in salt water without the waterproof case . it was submerged for about 5 minutes . it miraculously survived .
__label__positive__ this is the best of all my ip cameras
__label__positive__ flimsy handle .
__label__positive__ you get what you pay for unfortunately the wiring to come with us made very cheap . the rest of the product dvr cameras are good . if the wiring would be better i would have given a five star . i and up buying better wire and connectors it does make a big difference .
__label__positive__ the best and slick looking
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ love these , although i do n't use it in the conventional way , ie clamped to a surface for a flash . i use it & # 34 ; upside down & # 34 ; - i use it to hold a reflector , diffuser by using the clamp on the diffuser and the ball part screwed onto a stand - works great .
__label__positive__ such a fun item . really love flying this drone , best one out there for the money to practice with . only wish the battery life would last longer , but still a great product ! !
__label__positive__ good quality , fast delivery .
__label__positive__ everything fine . works great .
__label__positive__ it arrived at perfect conditions , it does n't come with mini film paper , so make sure you buy some
__label__positive__ wow . the nx300 is great . i like the light weight and the clean looks . the nx300 takes fine photos with the kit lens , but primes are awesome . i bought the adapter for the pentax lenses . i have five primes from my from my 35mm shooting days . the photos are gorgeous and the colors are true . the drawback is the legacy glass is heavy relative to the camera . the quality far out weighs the heft of the primes . i enjoy setting the f stop and manual focus . seems like the old days when i started photography , but much better results. < br / > < br / > i bought this from amazon on july 15th and got a great deal . this is worth every penny. < br / > < br / > i have the pentax 55mm f1.8 prime installed .
__label__negative__ absolutely hate it ! i know it 's not a super pricey item . i have purchased from neewer before , but this is the biggest waste of money . i know it 's not anything super high end , and it 's my fault for not checking along during shooting , but i have an entire photo shoot ruined . caused so much noise in the photos that they are not salvageable . no thanks ! it 's not even worth sending back , it will cost just as much . anyone want it ? it 's gon na go in the trash ... or i might just throw it in the street , see what damage we could cause it !
__label__positive__ i got what i expected , i ca n't complain ?
__label__negative__ terrible camera. < br / > auto focus takes forever . takes regular batteries . delay in snapping the photo . awful. < br / > terrible service on top .
__label__negative__ loose fit
__label__positive__ this case came earlier than i expected ! it 's adorable and exactly what i wanted ! thank you so much ! !
__label__positive__ good set
__label__positive__ love these lenses , especially the macro . they are easy to take on walks with my dog when i do n't want to carry my dslr . there is some adjustment to get the lens aligned on the iphone but they work great even with my case on the phone . best part , i did n't spend a lot of money to upgrade the camera phone !
__label__positive__ was not sure about this speedlight but i took a chance and i am glad i could . works in manual only but the output is easily adjustable , and has good powder . will purchase another .
__label__positive__ excellent ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ batteries perform at least as good as factory originals . no formal testing done though .
__label__positive__ great picture frame . crisp display love the motion sencor option and the transition mode of the display .
__label__neutral__ i need to leave this review in two sections ; one for the case , itself , and one for the strap. < br / > < br / > the case : it 's wonderful . it will hold a dslr or slr with an attached lens ( nothing over 4 or 5 inches ) very securely . there 's some additional pockets to put small accessories . a great bag for a quick trip. < br / > < br / > the attached strap : it 's way to small to fit cross-body . i 'm a bigger guy and the bag was sitting on my side ; nowhere near waist level , with the strap fully extended . my tiny wife tried it on and it just reached down to her waist level . i 'll be getting a longer strap somewhere. < br / > < br / > guess it just depends on your size and where you want the bag to sit .
__label__negative__ it wo n't turn on !
__label__neutral__ performs well , but immediately discovered we needed a larger screen size to be useful .
__label__positive__ thanks for the fast shipping . looking forward to future business . also it was an easy install and works great ! !
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid : e6ae971a9d7a76f98fef0daa444e2aee ] ] checkout the video for the specifics. < br / > < br / > overall nice in function but not always compatible with all phones it would seem . my htc one m8 seems to work with some and not others designed to use the earphone connected plug . with a borrowed iphone it works great. < br / > < br / > review sample for a fair , unbiased , and honest review .
__label__positive__ easy to use great quality
__label__positive__ it was exactly what i was looking for and arrived very quickly .
__label__positive__ fantastic product with no faults even it is refurbished
__label__positive__ a good little tripod for its size and price . not something i 'd like to hold a full-sized camera , but it 's great for one of the mini models , which are the most common size . i like it better than the spider-style a friend has , because that one , while versatile , is hard to get set up . this is easy . not a bad several bucks spent !
__label__positive__ i looked at several different devices and accidently picked this one . i failed to see that it was for a sony camera and i have a nikon . it does not fit a nikon but it was my fault not the seller . so i off to my shop i go and in about 10 minutes of sanding and shaping it now fits a nikon and it works as intended .
__label__positive__ oh my gosh ! ! i had bought the whole set and was really pleased in doing so . i got to take even more beautiful photos had i not bought the set . the set was amazing ! ! the photos are beautiful ! !
__label__neutral__ i 've yet to be able to get it to work correctly ... but i 'm hopeful
__label__positive__ excellent use on motorcycle . good quality already dropped them and it did n't even phase them and the recording ability ... tough and durable
__label__positive__ it 's what i needed and it 's stronger on the voltage . thank you for great customer service and shipment .
__label__positive__ this selfie stick has a few bright colors to choose from. < br / > < br / > build is solid . extends smoothly and locks in place . the protruding button protrudes and is easier to press. < br / > < br / > good hold and connectivity . recommended. < br / > < br / > disclaimer : a free product was provided in exchange for a fair and honest review .
__label__positive__ the batteries are at least as good as the original one supplied by panasonic for my lumix camera . with multiple sets i never run out of battery power on an outing . with a separate charger i charge all my batteries without the hassle of plugging in my camera to a usb port .
__label__neutral__ used manually , it 's a very good product , provided you are not tight on a product shot . i chose this over the pocket dolly because of the drag control , but it 's so sticky that i ca n't even use it . if you are buying this with the intention of using it with the second shooter do n't ! even though i use it with two 10+ lbs . tripods with 15 lbs . sandbags each , it has waaaay too much flex in it and bounces slightly as it moves along the track ( second shooter is pretty awesome though ) . i will probably end up getting a cinislider before long , to lose the bounce .
__label__positive__ ive been looking for this everywhere ! thanks for the prompt delivery as promised . worked like a champ
__label__positive__ great camera for the price.. used this camera on my nvr with no issues. < br / > < br / > pros < br / > 1 . ) vision works very very well on this camera ! ! < br / > 2 . ) colors are excellent and picture is crystal clear ! < br / > 3 . ) it includes an app for your phone plus there are tons of other ip camera apps on the android market that work with this camera ! ! i am currently using the nvr app and think it is excellent ! ! ! < br / > 4 . ) camera comes with everything needed to install ! < br / > 5 . ) setup and install was very simple ! ! < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > 1 . ) not wireless ( i knew this going in because it is n't advertised as being wireless ) < br / > < br / > overall : i really enjoyed playing with this camera and feel it worked very very well ! ! ! it was super easy to install , very easy to follow the instructions , and overall it is an excellent camera !
__label__positive__ i have a metabones speedbooster , and this thing is every bit as good ! the build is not quite as good , and its not super super solid on the connection , but that said , its not bad at all . just wiggles a bit ... . < br / > < br / > optically , brilliant !
__label__positive__ great camera , easy to use , takes nice pictures .
__label__positive__ excellent ! ! ! great price . prompt service
__label__positive__ when i first saw black dots in pictures at small f-stops and when recording videos i knew it was time to clean the sensor . i was quite worried if i would damage the sensor trying to clean this on my own . i was hesitant to even buy these right away . let 's just say i was glad i did . for reference , i cleaned my canon eos t3 which is an aps-c sensor. < br / > < br / > this product was a godsend to say the least . cleaned up all the dust and hairs within 20 minutes . most people advise against this , but i did use the same swab many times during my first cleaning . what i did was clean it up and peer in with a flashlight to see if it was clean . if it was n't , i would give the swab a good blow with a bulb syringe or wipe it off on a microfiber cloth and flick it to make sure nothing bad accumulated on it . took a few tries to clean , take a photo at f/11 , then inspect the photo for dust . i did finally manage to get it clean and love the results . no more big dust spots that my photos had been riddled with for months . no more post-processing dust removal needed . certainly , the worst place for dust is on the sensor . not as apparent when it is on the lens front element ( or scratches for that matter ) . < br / > < br / > however , one thing i did n't care for was the sensor fluid . it did make quite a few streaks on the sensor . it was easy enough to clean up with another swab , but be aware of that with this fluid . it never did seem to want to dry correctly . possibly too much fluid was in the drop . either way i ​was n't too impressed with it .
__label__positive__ this review is not about how well this camera compares to other cameras ; it is about what claims it makes about itself and how well i am able/willing to use those abilities to get what i want from a camera. < br / > < br / > therefore , as soon as i got it 3 months ago , i removed the ir filter and have never taken a regular picture with it - i have several other cameras that do that . it takes excellent ir pictures when combined with the several filters i have for that purpose . in that regards alone , it already scores 5 stars. < br / > < br / > i am now also able to contemplate and explore many other possibilities with this camera and ask myself & # 34 ; if i combined this filter with that lens at these settings under these conditions , what might i see ? & # 34 ; this camera alone gives me the most options photographically. < br / > < br / > and my purchase is about the fun and learnings i get from photography . this camera is about that. < br / > < br / > it is very well made and performs its functions as claimed . aesthetics is a personal matter always. < br / > < br / > i recommend it without reservation .
__label__positive__ seems to hold a charge well
__label__positive__ i really love this go pro . i 'm not the super adventurous one so the higher end models were a bit out of my price range . i wanted the lcd display and the wifi connection . it worked perfect on our trip to jamaica . we shot everything at 1080p 60 fps . the underwater footage was fantastic . battery life was perfect for our needs . about 2 1/2 hours of battery life for us . more than enough time to shoot . i would recommend this product .
__label__positive__ walter also did a very great job setting up my remote camera . he did so very efficiently , and professionally . am looking forward to installing the camera outside and seeing it work as planned .
__label__positive__ very robust ! ! i was impressed with the quality ... i was worried that it might come un-cliped but nope not yet
__label__positive__ great monitor ! it really works well , but i suggest getting a 2nd battery .
__label__negative__ only they used , and they are broke or not working where i can send it to the fix , since it has a one year warranty i am looking forward to your response thank you nelson
__label__positive__ good product and has excellent build quality
__label__positive__ makes handling smaller cameras a dream .
__label__positive__ this soft box is great for the price ! it was easy to set up and does the job well . getting it back in the pouch was a little hard but the same could be said about 99 % of these things !
__label__positive__ works great
__label__negative__ bought for my friends trip to africa & did n't even work , says needed battery or something : (
__label__positive__ no
__label__negative__ quality is n't what i would expect for a samsung . the casing is cheap plastic and the actual video quality is on the poorer side . i think my samsung phone ( note 4 ) takes better quality video . i was surprised and disappointed .
__label__positive__ battery
__label__negative__ do n't bother . do n't know what i expected for the money . fish eye is exactly that everything looks barreled , the other lens combination does absolutely nothing . very strange . packaging was probably worth more than the lens .
__label__positive__ excellent unit optically and mechanically , not what you would expect at the price point . highly recommended !
__label__positive__ it 's the bomb dot.com
__label__positive__ takes fantastic pictures , model is a little older now , but cant beat this camera at this price point . do not hesitate
__label__positive__ shipped on time . worked perfectly . : )
__label__positive__ another product that is way overpriced , but exactly what us video guys need . it 's aluminum foil people .
__label__positive__ exactly what i was expecting . nice quality , great price . even nicer that the owner hand signed a thank you in pen .
__label__positive__ if you are doing professional shooting , this lighting cube is definitely what you need ! i think those who really need this kind of lighting cube is for shooting the products . they either require a super bright lighting to have a pure white background or a black background for those reflexive objects , so that they only need to do very little trimming or cropping work . well , i have to say that i can see a definite improvement in my photos using this light tent . the led lights are very bright and three colors of backgrounds are provided : white , black and light orange . so it can be used for various kinds of objects . in addition , i really like the design of this tent . it gives you two angles to do the shooting : you can shoot from the front or the top of it . in this way , you can do the shooting with a tripod . of course , if you want your pictures to look good in a white pure background . a professional slr camera is required . i tried my iphone and the pictures look not so good compared to the slr camera . my camera is nikon 3000 . in order to get a perfect picture , the following settings are recommended : < br / > 1 ) manual mode ; < br / > 2 ) iso : 400 ; < br / > 3 ) shutter : 1/100 ; < br / > 4 ) aperture/diaphragm : f11/f10/f9 ( the lower the brighter . ) . < br / > i think the settings are very critical so as to get a good images . and it came with a bag for carrying . i just love everything about it .
__label__neutral__ why do n't they put stretch in these damn things so you do n't fight wrinkles in it nonstop ?
__label__positive__ really nice case . good construction . big problem my tamron 150-600 wo n't fit in it ! ! ! obviously i would n't recommend it for use with my lens but if you 're using a smaller lens go for it ! i returned it and got the large size which works just fine
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ best camera purchase yet !
__label__negative__ i should have read the reviews before i even purchase i would have never gotten it in the first place for adapters like this i 'll stick with the vivitar that i have on my 52mm
__label__positive__ love this camera ! took it to vegas right away during my trip and attached it to my car using a gorad pole ( the best gopro stick in the market ) . highly recommend and comes with great add-ons . just be sure to buy the additional dual-battery charger , as it is the only external power charger for the gopro hero4 black
__label__positive__ as a very novice photographer i ca n't go into great detail about the tech specs , etc of this camera , but i will say that i love using it and it takes stunning photos. < br / > < br / > coming from a basic point and shoot , i will say i still have tons to learn about all this camera can do , but at the same time i do n't feel overwhelmed by it. < br / > < br / > the shots are also lightning fast compared to what i am used to , so this really helps me not miss the intended shots of my kids .
__label__positive__ great price for this what you get .
__label__positive__ pretty easy to use , not sure how or if it can be used without wi-fi as in can be used cellular and it 's pretty slow to move the camera via wi-fi but it 's pretty cool and cheap .
__label__positive__ works find for my 72 lens . for the price ca n't beat it . t
__label__positive__ excelente producto !
__label__negative__ i could not get any of the / spy cameras that i got to work -- the720*480 would not charge < br / > all so i got 2 each of the mini dv from another place and thay did not work and i got on line < br / > to check there mauals and no go . so i got them and in the trash thay went now i know not to buy any < br / > thing made in -- -- -china
__label__positive__ this is such a nice reflector and gives a beautiful highlight in the eye . eyelighter is really large however , so be careful if you have a small studio .
__label__positive__ price is right , and it works fine .
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__negative__ it came damaged
__label__negative__ this selfie stick is average , it was a bit tough to use with an iphone 6 plus as it 's heavy and this stick did not work so well . it may be ok for a lighter phone . the whole arrangement kept collapsing every time i tried to extend it and use it with the phone . i am not sure what i did wrong but i did not want to take the time to figure it out during our vacation so we went selfie-less. < br / > < br / > the bluetooth button did pair with the phone easily and can be used separately without the selfie stick. < br / > [ received sample for review ]
__label__positive__ very surprised this is so cheap . the quality surpassed what i had expected . my only complaint is the selfie stick because it is very flimsy and feels cheap . every time i put the water proof case on the gopro , it falls . this bothers me .
__label__positive__ great lens
__label__positive__ fulfilled all expectation
__label__positive__ barely noticeable on the camera . my assumption is that this will break if the camera is dropped , but it would have done it 's job .
__label__positive__ easy to work with , great customer service . calvin was knowledgable and fast . i use these cameras to watch my property . they work well at home and when away
__label__positive__ thank you
__label__negative__ this is way hard to manipulate .
__label__positive__ i love this product it works great on my camara but what is best i get to take the two extra battery 's anywhere just in case one recharge . the only think that i had was the car charger it wo n't feet but other than that everything works great and the products arrive in time and they work wonderful .
__label__positive__ everything fits perfect in the bag .
__label__positive__ throw your glidecam in the trash ! or better yet , sell it to some film school freshmen who still has n't heard about brushless gimbals , and is enough of a sap to be excited about toting around an aluminum stabilizer stacked with lead weights… < br / > < br / > enter , the ghost ! man is n't 2015 awesome ? the great folks at spaulding international cinema rented me one of their ghost pro ii models to film a wedding in beautiful jackson hole , wy . i was blown away by this gimbal . with a quick release plate , and quick release adjustments , it was incredibly easy to balance and change cameras while on the move . it is also light enough that i was able to shoot most of the day without killing my back . adding an hd monitor was very simple , and the adjustable handles made it very comfortable . the battery life was incredible and i was able to shoot almost an entire day on a single charge . it powers up and calibrates very quickly which helped me catch all the action of the days events , without missing important moments . the ghost i was using was set up with two modes follow , and zero-motion . switching between the two modes only took the push of a button. < br / > < br / > the amount of different motions you can attain with this gimbal is worth the price alone . anything you can do with a slider , boom , or tripod , you can do with the ghost . it takes handheld filming to a whole new level , and will add a huge dynamic to your film making . plus , this is a product that is made in the usa ! get your hands on one !
__label__positive__ very well price for the unit . thanks .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ great accessory for gopro hero 4 black .
__label__positive__ this cover is a must !
__label__negative__ does not fit 1.25 scope i repeat does not fit 1.25 scope.the specs do state dimensions as 2 & # 34 ; but also states fits any 1.25 scope.i feel it was wishful thinking on my part but really bummed out my crystal clear night sky .
__label__positive__ great camera for the money , no complaints so far
__label__positive__ great case , flexible inside pocket is adjustable , heavily padded yet lightweight .
__label__positive__ product has a good finish and worked well .
__label__positive__ like most everyone else who writes a review this is based on short term use of this product . the light appears to be the same light as you see from other manufacturers . it appears that just the name is changed and slight price differences reflecting whatever the traffic will bear . as for the light itself it appears to put out a nice bright white light , which is good . the attached barn doors are a nice touch but do n't contribute much to the function of the light . i actually wish the barn doors were black instead of the silver shiny material . barn doors are to control spill , so black would be the best for professional use . i did a test to see how long the light could run at full power . take note this test was done using np-750 5000mah batteries . on full blast the light operated for 3 hours and 25 minutes . remarkably the light was constant throughout the whole time as the battery wore down . it did not dim as the battery weakened . when the battery is completely drained it came to an abrupt stop , and not a gradual loss of light which was good . so i would take it if you were using this light in a actual situation and not running full blast or constantly on , this light could last all day on np-750 batteries . that said the np-750 batteries might be somewhat heavy for camera mount depending on the camera you use . i use sony ex1r cameras so it 's not a problem on my cameras . it also works great on a stand . the included hot shoe attachment is sturdy but i wish it allowed you to tilt the light down or up , but it just allows a right to left tilt . maybe i 'm not using that correctly ? i also notice a flicker when adjusting the dimmer . probably not a problem as once the adjustment is made the flicker stops . something to keep an eye on though . these are the batteries that i am using in the test . http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00m2u6mnk ? psc=1 & redirect=true & ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 i actually prefer the wasabi brand of batteries and have placed an order which iwill receive today . once i get the wasabi i will test to see what the run times are with that . although i am completely satisfied with the 3 hours and 25 minutes at full blast . you can get the wasabi 's here http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/b001ner03w ? psc=1 & redirect=true & ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 time will tell , but at first blush this is the best light you can buy for under $ 50 bucks and it equals or surpasses some that cost 3 times as much . but take note the $ 50 bucks does n't get you a battery or a charger . so my initial order with the 2 5000mah batteries and charger came to roughly $ 83 bucks . again well worth it so far . i like the light enough at this stage that i have ordered another one , and if that works out i will order a third to make a kit . i already have a led kit consisting of 3 lights that are much larger and heavier and difficult to transport . this could be the perfect solution for a one man band like me to light small interviews . i certainly would recommend this light based on function and price . ****** after further use i want to make a correction and say that the light does allow tilting up and down . ****
__label__positive__ all the film worked perfectly . i had no problems with it . shipped quickly .
__label__positive__ just purchased a new pair of glasses and also a 13 pack of majic finer . great product . glasses are smug free .
__label__positive__ i have purchased many eco and edge systems from lorex ( over 28 and counting ) . this system is definitely an improvement over the older eco series that would sometimes have random glitches . the older lorex eco systems also seemed to lose internet connectivity , with this eco6 so far so good. < br / > < br / > the mobile and ddns are easy to setup as long as you know how to do port forwarding . you may need to adjust your modem 's and router 's settings. < br / > < br / > the stratus program for the cell phone is easy to setup when you use the eco id code . back then you had to enter all the settings with the id code it fills it in for you .
__label__positive__ this is by far the best camera , still or video , i have ever owned or used . both still and video images surpass my expectations , and the camera is very intuitive . the only criticism is that it is a little heavy , but i strap it tight to my hand and soon forget the weight . it has a steadying feature that works so well you would assume i am using a tripod .
__label__negative__ this cap does not fit onto my a6000 lens . totally disappointed .
__label__positive__ good quality . sturdy.. only problem is blue tooth not compatible with my phone : ( other than that , good product .
__label__positive__ beautiful pictures , and a fantastic range for the zoom . i love my new camera !
__label__positive__ great classic camera with easy instructions and use . perfect for field trips .
__label__positive__ i love this bag . it 's comfortable to wear and nobody would expect that it 's a camera bag. < br / > it 's not bulky at all . i have friends they even use it as a diaper bag ! the colors are exactly as pictured .
__label__positive__ very easy to use.. auto fit feature is excellent . black n white pictures are better than the originals..
__label__positive__ nice remote , have been using this for more than 2 years with my sony nex 5n and worked flawlessly . surprised family and friends when camera was firing off with no one around . earned lot of respect for being geeky among my friends because none of them know that most slr cameras can be operated with a remote . for many occasions set up the camera on stand in one corner and used remote to take random natural shots and poses during parties or gatherings .
__label__negative__ do n't get this for your tamron 70-300 vr usd lens . it does not work . also , that lens comes with its own hood that is really good .
__label__positive__ i use this product almost all the time with my kodak zi-8 camera to film concerts and day to day life . the gripping tripod allows for taking video from multiple angles . i would love an extra leg or two , or maybe just longer legs .
__label__negative__ first time using this flash on my nikon d3200 the flash was stuck on the hot shoe . small ball bearing on bottom of flash would not retract all the way so it would not release the flash . had to bring it in to have it removed . poor quality .
__label__positive__ best price i could find for the pack . actually has the dji emblem instead of the quad-copter logo . everything fits including prop guards , charger , etc . room for you pad is limited , but it can be stuck between shell and upper foam if you have one that is too large to fit inside . nice quality , great protection , without issue . not as big as i expected ( which is good ) , but its still a hard shell , so you know its back there when you are hiking . only one front cross strap , but its not an expedition hiking pack you know ! i 'm really happy with it so far !
__label__positive__ this skin is very hi-quality , after applying it with a hair drier , this skin fits like a gloove with no wrinckles ! looks totall awesome on my brand new phantom 3 pro ! ! ! ! they shipped it super fast ! ! ! ! very pleased with this skin , and even more pleased with the hands on customer care ! they are the best ! thank you !
__label__positive__ this camera takes great pictures and was a perfect way to capture our underwater experiences on vacation .
__label__neutral__ not a true dry box . not water proof . but is highly water resistant . it works . overpriced .
__label__positive__ my dog loves this thing and then watching her videos . not really , but we do : ) for my adventure lab this is not uncomfortable and she wont try to take it of . i do n't put it too tight , so after a while it can tilt the camera on one side . this wo n't affect the video too bad as you would think , so there is no need to keep it perfect at all times. < br / > < br / > i tried it one time on a small puddle and it works too .
__label__positive__ love it !
__label__negative__ i ordered this as a whole system , a few of them were good quality but sometime between 5-7 months they started crapping out , ir 's were not working , camera picture would be all white when shown in daylight , or would day 2 days to actually turn on . svat was good with returns , however some cameras that they sent back to me sucked more so than the ones i sent back . really need to do better quality control . i 'm glad to see they discontinued this line of camera
__label__positive__ once i worked out how to set up each button to a zone they worked a treat . very pleased with remotes .
__label__positive__ this camera bag fit my fujifilm s4430 perfectly . its front pocket has room for a battery charger plus pockets for spare sd cards . great price , too !
__label__negative__ the fish eye is so bad that the video is useless like to send it back
__label__negative__ does not support the weight of a nikon d7100 with 18x200 telephoto . legs collapse
__label__positive__ really easy to use for a low price ca n't complain so far
__label__positive__ excellent product - very pleased with it .
__label__positive__ i was surprised to find that these cables even existed . i have very limited use for this type of peripheral ( mostly video camera connections ) , but this has proven invaluable and allowed me to access some old material that i thought was long lost .
__label__positive__ my daughter loves taking pics i just do n't like the price of the film !
__label__negative__ this product is a waste of money . it 's not easy to use and when i received my copy of it , the dvd case was broken . two of the four dvd 's fell out of the case and i 'm currently in the process of sending it back . i had to use two of my own dvd cases to put the other two dvd 's in because the case that mine came in was broken .
__label__positive__ great product .
__label__positive__ had it for a few days . works well ... would buy from seller again : ) ... .. also long battery life / easy to use
__label__positive__ this film is the best and my goto ! the colors look great and it 's a good price
__label__negative__ worthless
__label__positive__ nice gift .
__label__positive__ very heavy duty . pan and tilt is smooth . skip the cheapos and go right for this tripod
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ we bought this to fit our ' nikon coolpix p600 16.1 mp wi-fi cmos digital camera with 60x zoom nikkor lens and full hd 1080p video ' . works great , no complaints .
__label__negative__ garbage , do n't waste your money or time .
__label__neutral__ i like wasabi aftermarket batteries but for some reason i have had issues with these particular ones . the first round stopped holding a good charge after a year and one of them started to expand to the point it no longer fit . it never leaked but still was concerning and in the end unusable . these are a second round so we will see .
__label__positive__ ( 8/3/2015 ) just received the sandmarc pole today , love the product . i bought this after extensive research and i 'm looking forward to use it when i go hiking , paddle boarding , snorkeling and diving at hawaii. < br / > < br / > the pole seem to be well made and i can see why it has received so many good reviews , the only issue i have is mine came with a defected strap button ( do n't know what else to call it , see picture ) . i will be contacting sandmarc and hopefully they can send me a replacement strap ( hopefully it 's easy to take the handle off and just replace it ) . < br / > < br / > update ( 8/3/2015 ) the sandmarc team works at lightning speed . i send them an email this morning regarding my issue with the strap button and in the afternoon i received an email from them stating that my replacement strap is on its way ! ! ! yay ! ! ! i 'll definitely recommend their product. < br / > < br / > update ( 8/5/2015 ) received my replacement pole this morning ! ! ! wow ! ! ! that was faster than i expected . i 'm happy with their product and service .
__label__positive__ excellent product quality , arrived on time and well packaged . would definitely recommend if you want to design your own case layout
__label__positive__ i 've been using this lens for a few months , and i am extremely pleased . i 've used the previous model of this lens extensively in the past , and i used to always recommend it to people and claim that it was the best lens you could get in the $ 100 price range . since trying this newer model i was blown away ! canon has improved the lens dramatically while keeping it at the same price ! what you get with this lens is great picture quality , an excellent aperture range ( a low aperture number like f/1.8 is what allows you to get shots where one thing is in focus and the background is extremely blurry ) , a very handy fixed focal length , superb autofocus that 's relatively quiet , all packaged in a lightweight body . the only downside i can think of with this lens is that when shooting in live view mode the autofocus can be a bit slow , but that 's the case with most lenses . if you 're looking for a lens that would be great for low light photography , portrait work , headshots , film , or street photography this is the lens you need to get . if you are looking for something that would be great for landscape photography i suggest checking out canon 's similarly priced 24mm stm pancake lens , and if you 're looking for a medium they also have a similarly priced 40mm stm pancake lens . those two lenses will not have the same aperture range though . i can not stress enough how amazing this lens is , for both the beginner and the expert . if you 're even mildly thinking about getting it , do it , you will not be disappointed .
__label__positive__ perfectly meets the expectations . thank you
__label__positive__ i will like it even more when i have time to read more of the manual and figure out how to operate more of the bells and whistles . i was told by a clerk at national camera that i would n't like this telephoto lens because it has a manual focus , and i would never be able to get it focused . hooey i say . i have had no problems focusing this lens .
__label__neutral__ fairly suitable knock-off ball head . i use mine as a backup on a camera slider . it 's not the best action , but it works ok . ordered 2 , one was sent back because it had a gritty feel , the other did not. < br / > i have no idea why there are 2 knobs for the ball presser . ( and one for rotation , which is nice ) both make the same adjustment. < br / > i 've had several different cheezy knock-off ball heads , and this one is the best of all of them , in my experience .
__label__neutral__ it served the purpose .
__label__negative__ too many parts not as easy to install as expected
__label__positive__ this is the second one i bought . i use them face to face to take pictures of coffee mugs using the mystudio ms20 . http : //www.amazon.com/mystudio-professional-tabletop-continuous-photography/dp/b0015450t6 < br / > < br / > see the china section of my site www.ibmjunkman.com for results .
__label__positive__ after finally taking this backpack with me on a recent hiking trip , i must say , i am nothing short of thrilled with its design . this backpack is made of an extremely lightweight material , perfect for carrying along on long hiking excursions . i found this out first hand as i attempted to summit mt . marcy , the highest peak in the state of new york . along what was a precarious and strenuous climb , my body was tested to it 's limits . luckily , this backpack exceeded my expectations . here 's why : < br / > < br / > as any experienced mountaineer would tell you , packing light is a cardinal rule . with plenty of space to store drone accessories ( and snacks ) , this backpack is the pinnacle of practicality . that is not to say it skimps on style . au contraire ! the sleek lines and padded shoulder straps cosset and cradle the contours of your back in a way , which i dare say , is nearly therapeutic . the designers of this backpack did not overlook any details- even down to the minutia of the soft-touch toggles attached to the zippers allowing one easy and ample ingress and egress to your bag 's precious contents . i look forward to seeing what else this brand has to offer because their quality , design and attention to detail certainly has captured my attention !
__label__positive__ love it
__label__negative__ it is nice , but the fact that you have to assemble it yourself i do n't like that . rating it 2 stars because mine came incomplete .
__label__positive__ i replaced my battery as a last ditch effort to keep my phone.. and it worked ! this battery works just fine in my nexus 4 . the packaging it came in was excellent and arrived in good time ( shipped from nj ) . a bit of background for nexus 4 owners.. it took a bit of troubleshooting to figure out the issue was my original battery . my phone would just spontaneously shutdown , or reboot.. when looking at the charge it would look normal ... when in the charger it would charge to 100 % etc . but take it out of the charger , 5-10 minutes later.boom ... reboot ... after a few days of this it degraded quickly to go into a deadly reboot cycle ... to the point it would only boot up if actually being in the charger ( a powerful charger ) i reinstalled both the most recent and older factory versions of android as some sites claimed issues with android os 5.0 . it was all for not ... regardless of operation system , i could not boot the phone unless being charged . so ordered this battery ( it 's not easy to replace , lots of youtube videos on it ) , removed the old battery which is adhered inside and popped the new one in ... works ! i have severed my cord dependency and there have been no issues with my phone since.. it can get warm when charging , but i think the nexus has heat issues anyways ... for 13 $ it 's saved me from having to drop a wad of cash on a new phone for now.. i 'm very happy . even if i do n't get years of use from this battery , the cost savings for me at this moment is well worth it .
__label__positive__ i got it , because i have a minute case of ocd . my gopro case has two battery slots . i had two , one in my gopro and one extra , therefore i needed one more to fill my case . it 's a pretty good battery , the gopro battery loses it 's power extremely fast . i know how batteries work , they lose their strength as time goes on , but having never used the battery , it lasted about an hour .
__label__positive__ loved it . this mount just took over all other mounts i have , after i bought this mount i almost stopped using all other mounts . i have extensively used this mount at great america pkway with almost all rides , here is the video link ( all rides shown in this video captured with this mount ) : < br / > https : //youtu.be/xx6zkzuam4m
__label__positive__ great case logic case . i got a couple of these on sale and gave one to my boss . inner lining is great for portable battery ( to charge cellphones or portable devices ) or for the intended mini digital camera ( reason i got one for the boss ) . its padded enough to protect anything inside falling from a height of about 2-4 feet ( 24-48inches ) to a hard wooded surface . cement surface protection fall about 2 feet ( 24inches ) . < br / > < br / > i use it for portable battery and extra compartment with universal usb cable to charge multiple devices simultaneously ( i will post my on-line review link in the future ) < br / > < br / > i 've had it attached on my belt for 6 months now , no wear in site . it lasts thru belt changes .
__label__negative__ it did not fit my lens
__label__positive__ great product ; great seller , great price
__label__positive__ excellent ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ efficient visual display
__label__negative__ for fun is ok but you 'll get what you pay . ca n't compare to gopro lol
__label__positive__ i bought this charger for my canon sc280 camera . i was very pleased with the value and it works great . i would buy it again .
__label__positive__ worked great .
__label__positive__ nice lightweight & adjustable ! very , very , very bright ont he highest setting . this will also take aa batteries or other various camera batteries . includes the shoe/tipod mount . very happy with the product .
__label__negative__ i bought this kit for its charger . however , the charger is not compatible with the batteries . the contacts are in the wrong place and the batteries wo n't charge . waste of money .
__label__positive__ this is a good camera to amateurs or begginers in photography . i liked a lot my purchase . it was a good deal with the best price . 10 dollars more for one kit with a lot stuffs to use , including an extra battery . i already used it to take a lot of nice pictures .
__label__positive__ review changing from 1 to 4 stars : seller was helpful with a full return . some of the products in the kit were defective or did not match the intended usage - giving the 4 stars for customer service . original review : the macro lens received is not as advertised with the various levels and it is only 1 piece that attaches to the wide angle lens . both telelens and wide angle lens totally vignette on the sony cx580 although they describe the lenses are specific for that camera . i have to zoom in 25 % or more to get rid of the vignetting . the lenses do come up with a stepper ring 30-37 mm and one of them was totally jammed to the lens . i had to use special torque equipment to remove them to avoid damaging the ring or lens . sorry i was expecting a slightly different set . i feel that what was advertised is not what i received .
__label__positive__ perfect item to add to your kit bag . i will use for wild life shots primarily and selfie family photos as well .
__label__positive__ love it
__label__positive__ got ta love that pick n pluck foam ! i 'll be ordering for my other cases .
__label__negative__ very bad product . it show no value for money
__label__positive__ was torn between this one and nikon aw130 . ended up with this one because of the 60 fps when taking video . i love this camera , takes awesome pictures above and underwater . was thinking about buying a second battery but the charge on this one is very long . wish the camera told you how many more minutes you have on your battery . i always let is soak in fresh water for 10min after using it in the ocean and let it sit for a good 8hrs before i open the battery door . no leaks . have n't played with the wifi , but why mess with it when it takes 2 sec to hook up the usb to a pc . i would recommend this camera .
__label__positive__ works well , and very good advice
__label__negative__ this camera was the most difficult installation i have ever come across ( updates are way too complicated ) and support and software was lacking . would not recommend this camera to anyone ! .
__label__positive__ first let me preface this by saying , i work in it . i have a very good knowledge of networking and still had a very frustrating time getting these cameras operational. < br / > i bought 3 for the outside of my home . upon receipt i found the boxes to be very sturdy and attractive . i opened the boxes and found the cameras wrapped in foam type bags . packed well . the cameras are actually a about the size of a tennis ball and are enclosed in an aluminum housing . there is a network cable coming out of the back of the camera with a poe network connector . this takes the power off the easterner cable and powered the camera . the mount is a mounting plate with threads on the outside edge a threaded ring and a cup that sits in the ring . the camera sits in the cup and as the ring is tightened onto the plate is locked into position . ver sturdy mount but not the best for fine adjustments . i chose my mounting positions , drilled 1 1/2 & # 34 ; holes for the poe adapter as it has to be behind the mounting surface . i ran cat6 cables through the attic and connected the cameras . i have a professional grade 24 port poe switch so i did n't have to have power injectors or power nearby for wall warts ( sold separately ) . once connected they were accessible via web interface using the default zip address listed in the instructions not sheet . unfortunately that was the only way i could access them . the web interface is decent and provides a lot of detailed access to the camera setting . some of the setting are difficult to figure out if you are a first time user of this brand . one nice feature is the ability to record direct to file on a networked pc or network storage device . that is if you are familiar with designating network paths . any way , i set ip addresses for each , went through the other setting not changing much and saved . the ip address changed as expected and i attempted to connect to my network video recording software . i have blueiris software running on an older pc and my plan was to connect them to it for recording . here is where the problems began . the instructions that came with the cameras provide no useful information at all . no manufacturer , no nothing . blueiris can usually pickup most cameras . but this time , no joy . i tried contacting the vendor to get some manufacturer information as these are private branded models in hopes of finding some info on the manufacturers website to make connection simple . instead i received a return email with more useless information . after a week of trying and emails i was finally able to get them connected to blueiris . the are working perfectly now . great picture . work great outdoors . just very lacking in the instructions and information department . by the way , they are packed with a cd that contains some software for these units but again no addition documentation . it has a network video recording software but it is not worth the trouble . you can get much better for less than $ 50 like blueiris or by using a cloud based subscription service like sighthound . overall very capable , solid built cameras , just be prepared for some headaches .
__label__positive__ this little camera is awesome ! just as good as the gopro in almost every aspect . this is a legit one too , not a copy ! mine came with the latest firmware as well . i have used this to shoot some action video and time lapse video and have been very impressed . my friend uses one in his drone with excellent results . the footage shot on this camera uploads right into gopro studio as well for super simple editing . it also works with many gopro accessories and mounts . do n't be a sucker and spend upwards of $ 400 unless you really have a need for 4k video or true 60fps footage . this little camera will not disappoint !
__label__positive__ this is perfect to support a laptop tray . i got the kupo vesa monitor adapter which i fasten to the baby pin on the top of the column of a c-stand , and this arm with a matthews dit tray to the column and i have a little tether station . i super clamp a power strip to the stand and use a base with wheels , super easy to move around . it 's also a cool option for mounting an extra light or a modifier .
__label__negative__ battery camera came with did not last very long . then i got a duracell which was but a bit better . i tried one last time . may be camera . battery does not stay charged very long . i bought a new sony 20.1 mp . do n't waste your money on the casio .
__label__negative__ need to return . it is an inferior product . day one a motor wo n't work
__label__positive__ it was amazing and came fast !
__label__positive__ good fit , came on time
__label__positive__ bundle worth buying ! the product description is slightly misleading because the 70-300 mm lens does not come with the package -- but it is a wonderful deal nevertheless . additionally , pinpoint has extremely polite and generous customer care representatives . extremely happy with my purchase and the way customer care addressed all my issues with utmost patience !
__label__positive__ i had an op/tech strap -- one that i 've had for almost 20 years -- on my old camera , so when i got a new camera i thought i 'd splurge and get a new strap for it . i was thrilled when i saw that op/tech still made straps , because obviously my old one has served me well over the last two decades ( and still looks quite good , actually ) . the new one is just as comfortable and useful as the old . love the slightly cushioning effect when i walk with my camera hanging from my neck at events . highly recommended !
__label__positive__ great product and fast delivery ! ! !
__label__positive__ good enough
__label__positive__ they work great
__label__positive__ not made cheap this is a steardy tool i use it on gun range in windy days does more then i expected it be for $ thanks for the deal
__label__positive__ awesome little camera . i like the features and definitely the price . need to practice a little with the app and order back up batteries for my longer motorcycle rides .
__label__positive__ great case ! ! took it overseas and it held up through a lot of abuse ! !
__label__positive__ great system , support staff is very patient , helpful , and knowledgeable , their expertise of their product is priceless . thank you all for the assistance setting up my system lake ...
__label__negative__ sent back immediately after opening up and trying it out . not for anyone who shoots professionally , strictly for & # 34 ; gimmicky & # 34 ; shots . i was curious for the price but that died as soon as i tried it . i get better results using ps or in camera fish-eye . it opens up for a wider shot yes , but you still have to still crop because image frame is much smaller !
__label__negative__ the unit would not operate correctly on my win 8.1 network . but may work just fine on a system already configured for hd video .
__label__positive__ have three cameras installed in my house , in lieu of baby monitors . much more affordable and the cameras work perfectly . had an issue attempting to set them up , after moving , and called customer service . they were able to fix the problem and installed them within 20 minutes ( including wait time on hold ) . kenneth ( the tech 's & # 34 ; name & # 34 ; ; ) was awesome !
__label__positive__ buen producto .
__label__negative__ wo n't work with fl lenses . went it back .
__label__positive__ long lasting batteries , surprisingly short charging time , only about 1 1/2 hours the first time ! very happy with the timely delivery , last but not least .
__label__positive__ not top of the line but great for the beginner . just be careful while screwing them on the lens .
__label__positive__ perfecto - works well with astrophotography
__label__neutral__ not as easy to focus as i thought it would be
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ better
__label__positive__ works with what i have . camera , waterproof case , selfie stick fit in the larger compartments . charger , extra batteries and smaller accessories fit in the netted pockets . took about 2 weeks from china to receive it after ordering it .
__label__positive__ this is a really neat product ! from the outside , it really does look like there 's a tv on in a room . it changes to different colors , multiple colors , dim , bright , etc . just like watching tv would . this is perfect to set-up and leave for when you 're out of town or on vacation , or just to make it look like someone 's up and awake watching tv instead of everything being pitch black. < br / > < br / > i also had to contact customer service for an explanation of the features on the back , and they responded very quickly , sometimes within minutes. < br / > < br / > i received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review .
__label__positive__ as expected . excellent !
__label__neutral__ video is excellent , but audio is really bad .
__label__neutral__ zoom range is way too short ! ! buy the first model and save hundreds $ $ $ . image quality is the same ! other than zoom range , it is the best pocket camera for most people . you can obtain 20x24 prints with great quality ! ! but always look at your prints at the proper distance ! ! ! arm 's length for an 8x10 even for a full frame dslr !
__label__positive__ great service and price
__label__positive__ as advertised .
__label__negative__ i ordered two of these gopro wrist mounts to use while my brother in law was visiting on vacation . i used one while biking down pikes peak and it worked nicely . however , we then went kayaking on the colorado river . at one point of the trip , there is a 30 foot cliff to jump off into the river . when my brother in law went into the water , the mount broke and he lost his gopro and extended battery . it is now somewhere at the bottom of the river . i 've attached a picture of the two mounts . you can see that on the one he was wearing , the mount broke completely off . he lost his gopro , extended battery and all his footage from his vacation . i wrote the seller a week prior to writing this review but have not heard back .
__label__positive__ i bought one for my girls but have been using it quite a bit for myself . good quality and works really well . love it ! ! !
__label__positive__ great cam , very pleased with it , works great and easy to hook up
__label__positive__ i love it . it works wonderfully with my canon 5d mk3 . heavy duty construction . 4 stars because i think it 's overpriced . should be a $ 29.99 item .
__label__positive__ makes filming a breeze ! easy to use and works fantastic !
__label__positive__ excelent scope to have and incredible birding
__label__negative__ i need a phone number for amazon because of the accessories that i received . i called dji about this and they told me to call amazon .
__label__positive__ this is a good point and shoot camera for basic needs . there are n't a lot of controls on it , but it does take rather nice pictures . recommended for simple photography situations that do n't call for the need to adjust every last setting .
__label__negative__ i bought this thinking i could plug my fuji 3d camera into my sony 3d tv and see my 3d video . it did n't work . it does allow me to see pictures but not in 3d .
__label__positive__ i have n't had this set-up long , but i am very pleased with it. < br / > < br / > quality is top-notch . there are no worries about storage . i can keep watch on our home no matter where i am . security is everything to a paranoid mama bear like me. < br / > < br / > set-up was easy , although i 'm a pretty advanced techie . if you have half a brain , though , it should be pretty easy for you , too . it 's pretty straight forward. < br / > < br / > could i have gotten a set-up like this for cheaper ? probably . would i want to ? no . i am thrilled with my purchase , and recommend it to any who wants good-quality peace of mind .
__label__positive__ i 'm very pleased with my tripod came a lot faster than i thought . it 's a lil flimsy but you get what you pay for i 'm satisfied over all
__label__negative__ if i had only checked out youtube , and google prior to purchasing this camera . there is a long line of defects on this particular model . mine was poor focus . all pics , and videos were blurry and out of focus . i tried adjusting the exposure settings , white balance , frame width , 4k to 720 , even cleaning the lens before i took pics . i emailed go pro , after 2 weeks of emails exchanges , including me sending them some samples they agree to swap out my camera with another one . guess what ? same issue , the replacement is just as bad horrible focus . for the price i paid , this model has a plastic lens . don ’ t go by reviews do a search on youtube about this specific model , you ’ ll see what am writing about . obviously gopro pulled this model , and discontinued making this for a reason , yet older models are still on sale . makes you wonder ? buyer beware , this is an expensive camera that is not worth the price imho .
__label__positive__ this is a great case for carrying your go pro and accessories .
__label__negative__ eh ... broke after a few uses
__label__positive__ well built mount . it most important part of a mount is the it is solid with no vibration or slippage . this is a great mount . likely i will order more . the ball joint allows infinite positioning possibilities . the best mount i have .
__label__positive__ ok
__label__positive__ this package is legit . buy it .
__label__positive__ smooth transaction . a+++ . thanks you ! ! !
__label__positive__ camera and package were received in perfect condition . the items included in the box are good for the extra price paid . microphone , flash , and led light all require batteries to operate .
__label__positive__ this is larger than the one that came with the camera and i thought i was sent the wrong product . but once i realized my battery would fit in the larger receptical and charging began , i was very pleased . it is fast charging and would recommend this product .
__label__neutral__ our dial was broken but we did not get a chance to return it before the 30-day window . luckily , the manufacturer fixed it under warranty it just took a while .
__label__negative__ this camera takes worse pictures than my 6 year old lumix camera . i sent it back and i 'm still using my lumix , which has a broken zoom lever until i find an adequate replacement .
__label__positive__ i am seeing a lot of bad reviews and it is somewhat perplexing . there seems to be a quality control issue and an array of various problems with these units being reported . i have to say that i have not had the same experience. < br / > < br / > i own three of these units and the odin transceiver . i 've had them and used them many of times in the past four months and they are as solid as anything . let me say this again : they are fantastic . they have functioned perfectly every time . they are built just as well as oem versions and offer more than pocket wizards. < br / > < br / > i 've used them on camera and off camera and with and without the odin . sometimes i use one as an on camera flash and transceiver to control the others . 100 % of the time they have worked everytime. < br / > < br / > i 'm not going to go into the specifications of what these babies will do and , instead , will tell you that they do it all and very , very well. < br / > < br / > i am sorry to those of you whom have not had the same positive experience as i . maybe i just got lucky . and to those of you whom are looking at this unit for purchase i will say that i am very happy that i decided to take a leap of faith and make a purchase . i hope you will be , too .
__label__positive__ this is the best camera case i have ever purchased . it is soft and pink , which i have never seen . when i go out to a large crowded area i know my case and never get confused with poeple i am with. < br / > it can hold batteries , camera and cards . i really like the loop connected so i loop it to my pocketbook for site seeing . best buy , quality for your money .
__label__positive__ these along with the ones that are 90 degrees lets you make any angle you can imagine . they do fit tight and hold well .
__label__positive__ i purchased the 2 pack wasabi power batteries for a sony rx100m4 . i have nothing but positive things to say . they seem to last slightly longer than the original sony batteries , and are a fraction of the price . if i need any additional batteries in the future , i wo n't hesitate to buy these again .
__label__positive__ easyh to instal . camera magnets to it , just like a stock mount . gives an obtuse rather than acute angle for options for pointing the camera .
__label__positive__ they work & are great to have handy in your handbag or wallet . they come individually wrapped so they stay clean until you need them .
__label__positive__ was very pleased with the product , ca n't even tell it 's there , would recommend , just have to follow instructions and get it on the first time to avoid bubbles . i am very picky about things i love this product . work great to protect your expensive camera screen : )
__label__positive__ my dropcam pro stopped working and the nest company replaced it for me free . very supportive and reliable company and the new cam works brilliantly . the company was very responsive and quick with their service . thanks nest ! so i have bought another cam .
__label__neutral__ while i do recommend the product i ca n't say i would trust it . the actual camera and microphone hardware is great , it 's the software that does the product a disservice . firmware updates often introduce as many bugs as they fix , the included web-browser plugin frequently crashes and requires a refresh/relogin . while the wireless does work it 's not nearly as stable as using the hardwired ethernet . i find myself having to reset the actual unit at least once a week as it will randomly decided to not accept connections . during our initial use of the product as a baby monitor we actually used a supplemental audio-only device for redundancy as the foscam could not be trusted to hold a connection over-night. < br / > < br / > it 's not all bad , it is hd , does n't require the use of the cloud , and can work with almost any viewing platform ( we watch it via pcs , blackberries , and amazon firetvs ) . < br / > < br / > i ca n't help but thinking that this generation of foscam products are still the versions from black-and-white world of the infomercial : where someone is fiddling with a product before giving up with an exhorted & # 34 ; there has to be a better way ! & # 34 ;
__label__positive__ nice design ! very good construction . camera and accessories fit nicely .
__label__positive__ delivered promptly , item was as described . charged the two batteries and am ready for a day with my camera . will shop with vendor again .
__label__positive__ used this case while white water rafting . i was able to fit two dslr cameras into it and they remained dry and protected . able to stand on the case too without impacting its contents .
__label__negative__ charged one set of batteries right after i received it . after not using it for for a season it would not work for the second set . it will not even light up for the battery charge .
__label__positive__ great scanner ... .easy to set up and works well with all types of pictures ... .scans pretty fast and accurately without messing up ...
__label__positive__ good !
__label__positive__ just what i wanted .
__label__positive__ met expectations .
__label__positive__ works for me
__label__positive__ great price , quick shipping

__label__positive__ love this lens hood .
__label__neutral__ picture quality is acceptable . frame rate is 15 fps instead of 30 fps , only delivers 30fps at 720p . lens angle is only about 90 degrees horizontally , not the 170 degrees advertised . when it arrived the field of view was printed as 140 degrees , unlike the listing. < br / > < br / > mounts are excellent . i put the adhesive mount on the wing strut of my float plane and it held on through waves and wind . battery life is about an hour and fifteen minutes . splits movies into twenty minute clips , when it starts a new clip the sound is horribly distorted for 2-3 seconds . remains a good , low cost camera , but substantially reduced capability from what was advertised .
__label__positive__ i bought this as a replacement for an 10 year old 300d . there are several dslr cameras to choose from with a wide range of features & prices . i liked the features of this model and the price . it works very well and is definitely a step up from the one i had .
__label__positive__ no problems . thanks !
__label__positive__ the housing can go with thwe other compllement < br / > for the tripod
__label__neutral__ did not come with the remote clip that is pictured . is n't a problem for me but it would be nice to have if i got the remote in the future .
__label__positive__ worked well and served its purpose .
__label__positive__ this accessory kit fits my canon camera prefect . it is a great accessory to have to protect the len .
__label__positive__ : )
__label__positive__ very helpful item , thank you very much
__label__positive__ this camera exceeds all my expectations . together with the new lens it takes magnificent pictures . if i were to criticize the camera it is too versatile.the learning curve is very steep , exponential in fact . many of the features of the camera are to me superfluous.i just want to take really good pictures that can be printed 17x22 or larger with amazing detail . i want to do good classical photography . i am not interested in & # 34 ; art & # 34 ; effects etc. < br / > that being said , i think the potential of this camera is spectacular i had an e-30 which gave me beautiful detailed 17x22 prints . i got the olympus because it allowed me to use my leica lenses . i am accustomed to the very best , and i think this camera approaches it . .
__label__positive__ light , reliable
__label__positive__ product is ok
__label__positive__ worked on 4th of july when squall blew through during fireworks show
__label__positive__ works great . it is a little heavy .
__label__positive__ works great ... little trouble at first and then & # 34 ; kazam & # 34 ; ... works excellent ! i was a little disappointed because i thought there was a two note door chime that would ring when the door opened . it is a longer chime , but it does have a lot of tune choices and volume settings . overall very good for the price ... .considering a second one..
__label__positive__ great product !
__label__positive__ great product . great service .
__label__positive__ was for the camera
__label__positive__ really comes in handy . the batteries have as much power as the gopro battery . it comes in handy when i am out all day and need to be constatnly using my go pro .
__label__negative__ same camera as the annke , just seems to sell under different name . even the app they use is the same mipc < br / > < br / > http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00r4hekyy ? psc=1 & redirect=true & ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00
__label__positive__ strong , well made , exactly what i needed for a very good price .
__label__negative__ looked great when i took it out of the box - even had a place to hardwire an alarm system . set it on a chair and then tried connecting to my wifi . trouble is , my wifi is hidden and i could n't find any place in the settings to connect to a wifi that is not broadcasting an ssid. < br / > therefore , i had to turn on my other wifi which is not hidden in order to connect . after a struggle i got it connected , tried moving it around with my smartphone , looked at live view and recordings , so far not bad and fun. < br / > the fun started to fade when i could n't find any way to delete some of the recordings i made without formatting the entire card and starting all over again . then i started getting many alerts when there was no one or nothing in the room - not even a moth . so tons of recordings started appearing on my sd card , minute after minute . there were no fans and nothing that moves in the room except the hands on a clock 20 ft away. < br / > the android app was also using tons of data even when i wa n't looking at anything . ok for wifi but not for cellular . so i found i could exit the app and maybe then it would n't use any data . but then i get no alerts - what good is that ? so i 'll turn off the alerts and only turn it on when i think i need them . ok , but when i turned the alerts back on , i did n't get any even though i came home and walked in front of the camera . so i had to get out of the app , sign out and then back in again . whew ! < br / > so if you do n't mind fiddling with resetting , formatting , reconnecting etc . it 's fun , but i do n't think it 's a hundred dollars worth of fun . is there anything out there that really works like it 's supposed to ?
__label__positive__ i looked around for several days and this was my pick . it 's built solid , has quality locks and a retractable metal spike foot that allows for a good grip and easy panning , along with a wide rubber foot for other applications . can also double as a good hiking stick . if you 're not ready for the sirui 204s , this is my recommendation . definitely worth the money .
__label__negative__ while the original ones that came with the package worked well , i think these replacement packages are way overpriced , they used to be $ 18 ( i think ) , now they are $ 8-11 depends on where you buy it from . i tried to look for a cheaper alternative and i realized that these are simply 3 watch batteries number lr 726 stacked on top of each other. < br / > < br / > with a little bit of research on amazon , i bought a 100 pack for $ 7.99 , which is equivalent to buying 11 of these 3 laser ammo packages . i ordered these ( ag2 396a lr726 sr726sw cx59 lr59 sr59 397 button cell batteries [ 100-pack ] , 2-3 days ago from focusparts ( see link below ) , although you can buy them from any other seller , they arrived very fast and the only issue i had was the expiration date printed on the package is 2 years from the manufacture date , which is not printed and that to me is suspicious , they worked great although i just received them today , so not sure how long they will last . i really tried to find a known brand like maxwell or energizer but they ere not available at least on amazon. < br / > < br / > the trick is when you put the three of them as is with the ( + ) sign side up in your surestrike laser module , your laser will be on constantly , so you have to break the circuit . the way i did it is by stacking the three of them together , then i wrapped all of them together once , all around , in a blue paper painting tape , leaving only the bottom ( - ) and the top ( + ) poles exposed , to prevent the sides of the ( + ) poles from touching the metal walls of the laser module , which broke the circuit , and finally voila , it worked like a charm. < br / > < br / > link : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00ilxz5bw ? psc=1 & redirect=true & ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00
__label__neutral__ it works alright . i wish the legs were a bit sturdier . i have a canon 700d ( t5i ) and i think my camera is too heavy for it . the legs are thinner than i expected . this item would probably work really well for a small digital camera , but for a dslr camera it is too light weight . the legs bend really easily and stay put . but the quick release plate for the camera is really weak for a dslr and i 'm constantly worrying that my camera is going to fall off .
__label__negative__ camera picture was very fuzzy did n't care for it .
__label__positive__ thanks for the description of the product . without it i 'd probably ordered the wrong one . found the tripod at a great deal , but needed the plate , works perfect .
__label__negative__ did not work with nikon d3200
__label__positive__ nice cameras for the price
__label__negative__ i bought it half a year ago , brand new , set up today . its motion detection detects someone walk to it at a arm length ( 2-3 ft ) in daylight . if standing/walking beyond 5-6ft , it detects nothing and records nothing . there is no continuous recording options . called support , it says that the camera built that way , nothing they can do about it . their & # 34 ; tier two support & # 34 ; says that they 'll call manufacture . the camera is useless , unless you want motion recording within 3-4 ft .
__label__positive__ great product , great delivery - made the job quick and easy
__label__positive__ thank you
__label__positive__ i bought these specifically to take on a train trip where there would be a lot of of scenic things to view and they did the job .
__label__positive__ great quality , good starter camera
__label__positive__ great replacement cable for a fraction of the cost of name brand . works perfectly !
__label__positive__ love this camera . just wish it was easier to configure for remote access though . u need to know how to configure router port fowarding n make surr ur isp isnt interfearing by blocking ports to enable remote viewing so thats a pain but if u just wan na link up to a computer in ur network to record its a snap
__label__positive__ vincent did a great job taking care of our problem !
__label__positive__ oh my gosh i had bought this camera from amazon and it was great ! ! it was in good condition , it took beautiful photos , and it so stylish . i loved it ! ! ! it was exactly what i was expecting xd if you want to buy this camera ... buy it here from amazon ! ! !
__label__positive__ i really love the look of this , i just wish there was an easier way to take pictures without having to take half of the case off , mostly because it 's rather cumbersome to take off . i can see why this has to happen with the camera , since there 's no viewfinder . i wish instead of snapping in place on the bottom the fastener was better so it could & # 34 ; hang & # 34 ; while i took pictures . you 'd also need another case to put this in if you had little things in your bag -- since it does n't close all the way around things can get jammed in between the case and the camera ( like paperclips , etc . ) however , it looks amazing .
__label__positive__ great bag for everything i need
__label__positive__ ok , i will make a non-bias review as best as possible . after researching multiple name brand surveillance monitoring cameras , this one is by far the best ! my honest opinion , this camera beats all the moderately average home monitors at half the cost . the hd quality is really fantastic . i zoomed in on my front door to make sure we 'd locked it before going on vacation , and i could see the handle clearly from approximately 30 feet away ... .i was four states away from home
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid:289c8af5a81a48f2628e9f0cfd9e79d3 ] ] speaking as someone who 's daily life is surrounded by microfiber cloths , from cheapie freebies , to cheap quality premiums , to fantastic quality ( but expensive ) and everything in between ... these are on the fantastic scale . these 8\\ '' x8\\ '' ones are bang-on perfect for my monitors and hdtv. < br / > < br / > as i explain in my video , there are two general categories of fiber naps - smooth , which these qkoo are , that are used for \\ '' polishing\\ '' , and thicker naps , almost terry cloth like , that are used first for heavy soiling . however , in terms of daily practical needs , like wiping eyeglasses or touch screens , you really only need the smooth polish naps . also works a treat for guitar body/fretwork cleaning. < br / > < br / > and i definitely appreciate how they all come in their own separately sealed ( and reusable ) packets . i try to keep all my currently unused cloths in bags of some sort because a dusty microfiber cloth will make a messy screen even worse. < br / > < br / > one last word about washing : yes , quality cloths like these are washable , but i never really got more than perhaps four or five washes out of any given microfiber cloth before they were pretty much \\ '' washed out\\ '' , losing that special micro nap and becoming more of just general wipe cloths . still , i had a set of planetwaves cloths that lasted a few years before i had to finally wave goodbye to them. < br / > < br / > - complimentary product provided for evaluation , yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes , and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations. < br / > < br / > i would so purchase this bulk pack again .
__label__positive__ works fine
__label__positive__ typical of manfrotto products : terrific ! the only thing preventing me from giving it the fifth star is that i thought it would have been a bit bigger , but it 's fine .
__label__positive__ takes excellent close ups
__label__positive__ amazing lens for the price point !
__label__neutral__ i hate the fact that i have to unscrew the grip overtime i need to charge the battery inside my camera body . other than that , this grip works well .
__label__positive__ picture clarity was n't really worth it - but it was just purchased for my kids to have something to take pictures with at their summer camp .
__label__positive__ i have n't used it underwater and i have n't dropped it . i 've taken a number of pictures and think that the picture quality is very good . i 'm gad that i got it .
__label__positive__ i love it ... great price too
__label__neutral__ i was gifted this by my girlfriend , and at the time it was around $ 350 . the comparisons i saw online vs the go pro lead me to believe that this camera was better in pretty much every way . the truth is the quality just is n't that good . i use this on my motorcycle for vlogs , but also for safety purposes and for safety purposes it 's good , not so much for vlogs . the quality is about a 7/10 . it fluctuates greatly in different shades of light . there 's only very few shades of light in which the camera looks great in , but for the most part the quality is n't impressive . the impressive element is the 360 lens , which for safety purposes on a motorcycle is great . it can capture everything around me for the most part , but again the picture quality is lacking. < br / > < br / > overall it 's a good camera , but at launch the price was too high imo . i could have spent another $ 50 and gotten a gopro4 which kills this camera in terms of quality . battery life and memory ... i 'm not so sure the go pro is as good , but i know the footage quality the gopro4 puts out and it 's beautiful . nothing coming from the sp360 has blown me away . now seeing the price of this camera nearly $ 160 less then i paid ( and i needed to buy an sd card ) i really see why it 's going so cheap . it 's just not real competition for the gopro at the moment .
__label__positive__ the best under $ 20 i 've spent so far . a must have if you 're doing long exposure images and has been good for my studio work too .
__label__positive__ does what it suppose to . although item is not as pictured
__label__positive__ fits , no problems
__label__positive__ it has good quality legs . it holds your camera good and it 's a good value for your money
__label__positive__ this pouch does fit my sony a7ii and zeiss 24-70/ f.4 lens attached . i have to remove the lens hood though . ( too short when the lens hood is on the 24-70/4 lens ) . it may be too big if you use it with sony 28mm 2.0 or 35mm 2.8 , or zeiss 55mm 1.8 .
__label__positive__ does what it says its gon na do
__label__neutral__ it seems like a piece of the total focus ring length doesn ’ t effect de focus mechanism , so it ’ s different ( for example ) a 0 ’ 7m distance if you come from infinite or if you come from 0 ’ 3m , the subject can be in focus or doesn ’ t depends on if you come from infinite or from 0 ’ 3 . after many tests i have seen that objects around 1m , focus 0 '3m and to the other distances , to infinity . not the most accurate way to run but in f/8 , f/11 it works .
__label__positive__ the canon bag is just what i needed to store most of my gear when it 's not in use. < br / > since i 'm retired now , i do n't see any regular need for carrying as much as it can hold , but it probably will go with me on cruises , and at other times when my car is not handy. < br / > the bag is very sturdy and well made ; replacing a previous bag ( not canon ) that broke at one of it 's plastic snap closures .
__label__positive__ absolutely what i wanted ! !
__label__positive__ i 've been using it for about a month now and in general i like it much better than a standalone camera bag i had before . i did consider buying a specially designed camera backpack but decided to go with this bag since i already had a backpack i like and bring with me on all my trips . after fitting in my gear ( a dslr + additional lens + flash and some other accessories ) i still had two padded dividers left ( not counting the one i even spent on thickening one of the bag walls to give more protection to the camera ) . this means you have more than enough dividers to fit all kinds of gear in it . the first real test happened when the bag fell off a bed about half a meter down to the floor . it just bounced back a bit and none of the gear was damaged in any way . another nice thing about the bag are the two small loops on the sides you can use to attach a belt if you decide to carry the bag by itself . the only drawback i can see is that the walls are too thin . upd : the aforementioned loops wo n't hold out long if used often enough . i had to carry the bag by itself several times with about 3kg of gear on a strap while flying ( border agents in canada complain that a camera as big as mine has to be presented separately so it 's a pain to put it inside a backpack ) and now one of the loops is about to come off .
__label__positive__ the box arrived in the time estimated , and in good condition . it 's nice looking even without being finished , but i used a polyurethane stain and it 's < br / > really very pretty ! i officiate at weddings , and at 5 ' 2 & # 34 ; , may of the couples i marry are much taller than me , making for odd looking pictures and ceremonies . it ; s just what i needed , except that for my purposes it would have been better if the matthews & # 34 ; logo had been only on one side of the box .
__label__positive__ the items was received on time as promised which i appreciated . the items is as good as advertised. < br / > i am impressed .
__label__positive__ was great like always . thank !
__label__negative__ the video quality was pretty good and the controls a little confusing but after a while i figured them out . after about 3 months it stopped recording . i realized this when i went to review some video . i noticed that the previous week was n't recorded at all . so i attempted to access the menu to investigate . the menu button would n't work ! it did work when i first set it up . now nothing ! the dash cam turns on but that 's it . i even took the dash cam out of my car when i was n't driving so it would n't bake in the summer sun . i realize that the g1w-c is on the cheaper side of dash cams , but still i figured to get at least a couple years of usage out of it rather than just 3 months . so , because of this i ca n't recommend this dash cam to anyone .
__label__positive__ got it a week early ! and it is excellent ! even though the & # 34 ; wifi & # 34 ; would not connect to my phone .
__label__positive__ it works great for the camera and the other pockets will come in handy for something .
__label__negative__ no support . no connection . we returned .
__label__positive__ works fine , set up the android app and now i can use it from any location if i have network on my phone , the only con is the camera resolution at 240 i will upgrade to 720 later but for 30 dollars cant complain . minus one star for the pixels to low . : )
__label__positive__ lasted longer than standard battery
__label__positive__ good stuff
__label__positive__ love it .
__label__neutral__ [ [ asin : b00mvgraou camkix frame mount for gopro hero 4 , 3+ , and 3 / all slots fully accessible - light and compact housing - includes a large thumbscrew / tripod mount / rubber lens cap / uv filter lens protector ] ] < br / > you can replace the battery , but access to side usb & hdmi connectors is not possible unless you remove the cover before installing the housing. < br / > sound improves dramatically
__label__positive__ does not last as long as i thought it would .
__label__positive__ i use this for a contour camera and accessories . i also can put my handheld gps in this case , along with other assorted doodads . i take this with me on an atv and appreciate the padding , and the adjustable dividers to keep things in their place . you can set the interior in many ways with the velcro-tabbed dividers. < br / > < br / > the bright orange interior is actually a cool feature - sometimes small camera parts and such disappear into the typical black camera case and that wo n't happen here . i also like the durable rubber base , i like to set bags down on rocks and with this there 's no danger of ripping the case ( as i have done before ) . i can also see setting this down on wet grass or whatnot and there 's no worry about water getting into the bag. < br / > < br / > it has a nice carrying handle , and i wish it had attachment points for a strap . however , you could easily use a carabiner to attach this to a belt loop , backpack or otherwise. < br / > < br / > i have several case logic products , including camera cases , and i love them all . they are all built nicely and are well-designed and durable . this case is no exception .
__label__positive__ i got this to house small adapters and crimp tools in the top of my 1510 . it really adds a lot of storage and got the small stuff from rolling around in the bottom of my case to being safely secured in the lid . my only complaint is the tall pocket on the right 's zipper zips up and opens down so when i open it to remove a crimp tool its a little difficult to get the zipper out from under the weight of the other tools in the pocket . get out the tiny violins , i know its a small complaint ! otherwise i absolutely love this
__label__positive__ have been charged several times due to vacation and birthdays . have held a good charge and long use of each battery . will buy more before the holidays .
__label__negative__ it does not have night vision and it doesnt connect to my iphone waste of money and time
__label__positive__ everything was perfect except that one of the bars was missing the cap at the end . so i am worried it will tear through the fabric in time .
__label__positive__ best purchase ever !
__label__positive__ henry was my tech supporter when i had trouble reconnecting my camera after a recent black out . he was very helpful and knew exactly how to fix my problem in no time . i had this camera for a while now and was skeptical of using it outside of my window seal because of the different weather conditions . however it has been there through every condition so far but snow and it still works . i recommend anyone who is looking for a dependable camera to buy a foscam .
__label__positive__ batteries as advertised mor power than factory battery
__label__positive__ for the price this thing is a beast ! , my only regret is that i did n't get two , so i 'm ordering a 2nd unit now . it 's bright , easy to adjust and makes a statement when your on a job . the only knock i have against it is i would have liked for it to have a battery powered option as well , no worries though , the cord that comes with it is pretty long and i have tons of extension cords . if you need a bright video light for a good price , stop reading and start buying .
__label__positive__ we put this in our entrance way for our business and it continues to work great !
__label__positive__ nice product
__label__positive__ love this device ! does everything they said it would do . install was a snap and video quality is awesome . now i can keep an eye on my basement/bar even when i 'm not home . very nice device !
__label__positive__ this is worth for money ... good product . .
__label__positive__ worth every single penny i paid for it . be careful that you get the nano coated version . the normal mrc model is available for the same price ; fortunately amazon let me cancel my order easily . rotating this polarizer against an lcd monitor completely blacked it out ( so long as you are looking through it like the camera would ) , so i know that the polarization is excellent . i took pictures of sky and glass and played with the effects . i 'd have to say this is the best accessory i 've purchased , aside from the camera and lenses themselves . as you would expect from a polarizer , it boosts contrast ( like good polarized sunglasses ) , and lets you select which reflections you want to see and hide . the latter means that you can see inside glass windows that would normally be opaque due to reflections . no vignetting on my nikon d7100 with 10-24mm dx lens . standard nikon pinch caps fit securely , although they do come off with less squeeze than i use with my protective hoya uv filter . still secure enough that i 'm not worried about it . i have not tried stacking filters .
__label__positive__ works amazing very easy to setup well worth the price !
__label__negative__ the camera produced no signal , or was incompatable with my dvr of same mfr . return process of defective product was very simple . i will probably order another
__label__negative__ did not meet expectation and returned for a refund
__label__negative__ other than it breaking 2 days after getting it , it 's great . i wish i could leave negative stars . biggest piece of crap . poorly made .
__label__negative__ exterior shipping package looked well enough , however the actual product package was cut up and had a hasty tape job . it certainly looked like something that was previously opened and return . from experience , i did n't even want to open it figuring either something is wrong with the kit , or certainly something missing . i did n't bother to open , and i returned for a factory fresh replacement . sure enough amazon customer service hooked me up with a factory fresh kit . you must understand that with this kit you get what you pay for . very flimsy hardware , which i was okay with because it fit my expectations precisely . i bought this kit for some experimentation , so durability was not a factor . the real reason for the 1 star is getting a kit shipped that should have never been sent , and then the replacement kit had a light head that was not working . if i could rate amazon customer service , they would easily get 5 stars .
__label__positive__ great deal and works great !
__label__positive__ good price , prompt shipping . very good products behave like oem prroduct .
__label__positive__ good grip as an alternative to the pricey canon product .
__label__positive__ there was a minor cosmetic issue with the case . i contacted the seller and they handled it in the best possible way . thanks !
__label__positive__ worked perfectly
__label__negative__ a little smaller than useful .
__label__positive__ our 11 year old grandson really likes it , as does his friends .
__label__positive__ seems sturdy enough to handle what my son throws at it . been on bike rides and under water and not treated lightly , yet holding up well .
__label__neutral__ the camera was supposed to be new , but it was an unopened box and the camera was not packaged . it did n't come with a card or the cable to upload the pictures from the camera to a pc . i only bought it as i had a similar one that froze up . so it 's okay , it 's cheap for what you are getting .
__label__positive__ great deals for my sony a7 and very fast delivery ! ! ! i think the camera feels more responsive in these batteries compare to the original battery !
__label__positive__ i wish the batteries came with the protective plastic cases like they have with past orders
__label__positive__ perfect . this one is your absolute best bet . i ordered another brand before this one for less money and had to throw it out . this one is well worth the money , bulit well and works as it should .
__label__positive__ great case . holds all of my components for my gopro
__label__positive__ everything was ok with the product and delivery . the product works perfectly !
__label__negative__ ordered this , received a 15x70 instead . great .
__label__positive__ worked as advertised .
__label__negative__ a bit flimsy .
__label__positive__ first off , amazon prime is great in price and delivery . what really needs to be said about any gopro camera is to get those smooth videos or crisp still shots you need to go thru trial and error over and over . it 's worth it to stick with it . the results are only as good as your efforts . do n't get upset in the early periods using your camera . the quality the camera can produce will always amaze you . i have the hero3+ silver edition . the most important accessory to buy first is the remote control fob , this will make your usage much simpler and control battery life . right now the smartphone app is having problems which become very frustrating , trust me on this . second buy an accessory kit , well worth it . think about what type of videos who want and buy what you can to help make it easier to get the results you want , i bought the & # 34 ; fetch harness & # 34 ; knowing i would be making videos of my dogs . hope this makes sense , hang in there ! your gems will come .
__label__positive__ this lens cap fits the lens and filter well and will not fall off when in place . the cap has a permanently attached tether that is about 11 inches long . highly recommended !
__label__positive__ loved this backdrop.beautiful is all i can say
__label__negative__ does not work ?
__label__positive__ bought this for my wife maybe a little more than she can handle but a very nice camera .
__label__positive__ for the price just great .
__label__positive__ inlived ur product but i expected to have instax mini film included .
__label__positive__ great camera , lost it in divorce and want it back .
__label__positive__ good ítem ! ! thanx
__label__positive__ works great , enjoy the different settings and sounds . on windy days i believe my flag sets it off , will have to reposition it .
__label__positive__ fits our camera exactly
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ used it while on the boat and it worked good . recently , though , the mount from the flex to the clamp broke . it still works but it is less secure ...
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ i take this everywhere i go . i havent met someone who has had this one yet but i always get some looks for having the coolest pole . the grip is comfortable and the arm extends to a pretty decent length . its sturdy even when extended . highly recommend !
__label__positive__ i love pelican cases . a bit pricey but they protect expensive delicate items . i ship things with value of $ 50k in these cases around the world and it is worth the expense and extra weight .
__label__positive__ as stated very happy with the deal
__label__positive__ great little case
__label__positive__ works great !
__label__positive__ the support team to this is just awesome they will help you all day if they have to
__label__positive__ great product delivered as advertised .
__label__positive__ i ordered the microfiber cloths for my glasses since i am constantly getting them smudged . these work great so far . best ones i 've used to date .
__label__positive__ good , fast shipping , that 's great : )
__label__negative__ no button to take pictures ! useless
__label__negative__ this case absolutely does not fit sony a6000 . it is way smaller than the camera with its smallest lens . we tried to stretch it but had no luck . will be returned .
__label__positive__ i wish they were a little heavier-duty , but they stick work great . and you ca n't be the price !
__label__positive__ this is an excellent product and i will be ordering again .
__label__positive__ love it
__label__positive__ used this item on a mud run as a side mount for my mhd 2.0 action camera . stayed on throughout the run . provided a good secure , steady platform . i wore it on the mudslide and it stayed on even underwater [ full disclosure ; i did have a hand on it as i hit the water ] . have not used it mountain biking yet . easy adjustment . good item for the price .
__label__positive__ awesome gift selection !
__label__positive__ tripod is a good buy if you are looking for an aluminum option . the legs are just a bit loose when you are extending them but they do fine once you have locked them in the spot you want . the ball head was easy to use and turning the camera horizontal and vertical was very easy . i would recommend spending the extra money and buying the carbon fiber tripod in the same brand . but it is just a preference .
__label__positive__ fantastic lens filter
__label__positive__ all good
__label__positive__ love it
__label__neutral__ i did n't expect much out of a cheap little camera like this , and it pretty much lived up to that ... video quality is pretty good . the motion detection settings are hard to figure out and it turns off when it feels like it . if nothing else it 's a fun little toy but do n't expect a whole lot . i would buy it again even knowing what i know now though .
__label__negative__ it broke very quickly for me even though i was careful with the tripod . i could n't fix it myself . there are better options in the market .
__label__positive__ fabulous . i can not believe i was able to take such awesome video of the moon . this technology is amazing . i photoshopped my cat on the moon . thanks so much for a great product !
__label__positive__ this is quite simply one of the best camera packs i have seen. < br / > < br / > it is a very well made , solid , and versatile way to carry camera ( or other ) gear. < br / > < br / > from the solid base ( which it stand on quite well ) all the way to the top handle , it demonstrates a high level of quality. < br / > < br / > the interior can be accessed either from the back through a dual zippered flap , or the top . the zippers seem solid and strong. < br / > < br / > inside , there is a lime green lining with matching lime green padded dividers which can be moved around and arranged to fit your particular collection of gear . the padded panels attach with hook and loop flaps and can be moved around to fit your needs. < br / > < br / > there is a strange ( but useful ) detachable strap designed to support your dslr hanging in the top part of the pack. < br / > < br / > there are a couple of extra zippered pockets , one on top , one on the back , which allow more gear to be carried , and which have smaller pockets sewn into them. < br / > < br / > there are two side straps above mesh external pockets and some reasonably well done shoulder straps for carrying as a back pack. < br / > < br / > there is also another large compartment on the back where the straps attach , which runs nearly the entire height of the pack , and has an internal , padded pocket. < br / > < br / > the quality of construction , versatility , and light weight make this a great choice for carrying camera ( or other ) gear .
__label__positive__ i bought these batteries and charger as spares for my new fujifilm hs50-exr . the batteries work well in the hs50-exr camera but do not provide the same level of communication for the charge level as the oem fujifilm battery . with the fuji battery , i can shoot another dozen images or so with the low battery indicator on ; the wasabi power batteries give me about 4 to 6 images with the low battery indicator on. < br / > < br / > i like the folding plug and the car power adapter on the wasabi power charger and the fact that the charger will charge both fuji and wasabi power batteries . conversely , the fuji battery charger will also charge the wasabi power batteries. < br / > < br / > i would recommend this product to others .
__label__positive__ great money saver
__label__positive__ good product , so far working very well 8/9/2015 .
__label__positive__ i do n't like typing
__label__positive__ recieved fast and works great . thsnks
__label__negative__ the camera works really well as advertised , but i am giving this two stars because the notch in the in-car holder where the camera is mounted is poorly designed . there could have been a thumbscrew there that keeps the camera from dislodging . when i go around a corner or hit a bump the camera dislodge itself and hangs down by the attached usb cable . as i said , good camera , but they should have thought of this design better . the suction cup that sticks to the windshield is broken and attempts to get a replacement from foscam is almost impossible . customer service number to foscam is in india , and after contacting them for service and questions the attendant hung up on me , twice . i tried emailing the customer service , and a person name shane peters responded , but when i sent him the information that he requested , two weeks had gone by with no further response from him . i will never buy a foscam product again , or encourage anyone to do so because of the extremely poor customer service when something goes wrong with their product .
__label__positive__ awesome technology with a seamlessly integrated experience . nest cam linked to nest thermostat and tied to a mobile phone with ifttt is the answer to all your home automation desires .
__label__positive__ great set of 3
__label__positive__ a very good system and price. < br / > < br / > i am not a it person but have a good understanding of computers set up . i was able to get the system up and running with relatively little trouble . the user manual does n't cover in detail settings you need to know or how to find them . it was through trial and error i was able to set it up properly . nothing major but a minor nuisance which could be avoided . connecting with the internet was straight forward but when i changed to a longer cable , something went wrong and the message & # 34 ; no internet data , please check all connections & # 34 ; , caused a great deal of checking and rechecking before it was suddenly back . what would be helpful here would be a dedicated line to amcrest to trouble shoot these problems. < br / > < br / > all in all , it is a good starter system , easy to use , cameras are as good as the cameras being used for roadside surveillance , you wo n't be able to read license plates but facial features are good , color is good , night vision is good . i would like to have had sound also but it is a very good starter system and i would recommend it to others .
__label__positive__ exactly what i needed for my camera . works just like it should .
__label__positive__ i am new to the slr cameras with a cannon dslr i received as a reward . i was able to use a couple of older lenses i got for a song . i am now able to expand my photography abilities beyond the limitations of the lens that came with the camera . this worked with a lens from jc penny 's that had a minolta mount . i am able to take nice interior portraits with the lens .
__label__positive__ very good product for the price ! ! do the job ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ took camera on vacation with me , it 's a nice easy to handle camera that takes great picture . i love it .
__label__positive__ excellent harness . made well . fits perfectly with easy adjustments . holds the camera ( canon 70d ) effortllessly and securely .
__label__neutral__ arrived quickly . tilt and rotating head a plus . unfortunately , my kids had a hard time adjusting length of pole . very hard changing from one length to next .
__label__positive__ ok now i know why everyone gushes about the camera . i 've been looking for a set of two cams to put inside the house for monitoring purposes , and though i 've never heard of this brand the reviews gave me enough courage to buy one , and after i 'm done with this review i will be buying another . the setup is truly a breeze , and everything works just like the quick-start card says . i left the resolution at normal ( a step below hd ) due to bandwidth issues but it 's clear enough to see . pan & tilt feature is awesome , so is the two-way audio capability . overall i want to say this is exactly what i was looking for and the price is right ( $ 0 for streaming ) . i have n't tried recording on sd card yet but will be testing that feature later . if you 're looking for a dropcam alternative that 's simple to setup and use , and you 're not worried about recording in the cloud , this is it. < br / > < br / > some minor concerns i have with the mobile app : < br / > - the login has no email address associated with it , therefore if you forgot your login & password , you 'll need to create a new one. < br / > - there 's no indication where the middleware sits , so the chinese government could be tapping into your feed , but then again our own nsa is probably doing the same so ... do n't stream stuff you do n't want people to see for free ...
__label__positive__ replacement ( upgrade ) for my fuji x-e1 .
__label__positive__ i decided to go with a reputable company that has many good reviews . i was not disappointed . the plug is very handy as it 's not a wall wart that blocks other outlets . powers my cctv camera and monitor with no issues . the power brick does n't get warm like other cheaper plugs .
__label__positive__ excellent , wish sony still produced these !
__label__neutral__ so far its decent . no leaks . the remote function ( connect to phone app ) doesnt work . color is lacking . but not bad for the price .
__label__negative__ this nikon speedlight flashed fewer than 100 times over a 2-year span , and then completely failed . pure junk . i 'm appalled .
__label__positive__ it is excellent , for the price , i ca n't describe technical aspects , but it is good . why not five stars ? because it is not really 20 x 22 , i would say that it is a 10 x 22 . but if you are looking for outdoors daytime binoculars , you do n't have to pay too much , this is good , simple , handy , and practical..
__label__positive__ these are great attachments for their monopod/tripods-monopods-bluetooth-selfie-stick and the gopro slides right into the grooves and secures very tightly ! you do not have to worry about it coming off at all ! my husbands friend has a gopro , and is begging me for it ! great attachments ! < br / > disclosure : i received this product complimentary for review purposes . all opinions expressed are completely my own and may differ from yours .
__label__negative__ i do not know who to use that item < br / > meca1456 @ netzero.com < br / > thank
__label__positive__ ok
__label__positive__ a must have for every go pro enthusiast
__label__positive__ works great with my web cam and is easy to transport .
__label__positive__ if you use a mobius as a dashcam , you need this. < br / > < br / > open up your mobius and see if the oem battery is swelled up , and bloated . that 's from heat . if you use the mobius as a dashcam , get this super capacitor
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ great camera .
__label__positive__ this is so easy to use and my dad is thrilled with all his old service and college photos on his digital frame . this is a great gift for low tech folks who just want to enjoy their photos and videos .
__label__negative__ perhaps it is me as a techno-phobe - quite possibly - but it seemed this $ 500.00 camera was shipped with a memory card so small it only held 10 photos and i had to replace it . is that the case ? if so , this would have been good to know as an alert before i departed for my international travel .
__label__positive__ great product , alarm up and working again
__label__positive__ this rocks . way better than buying from olympus in every way : capacity , price , weight , size of charger . my only complaint is minor is that the battery very loosely clips in .
__label__positive__ these have lasted longer than original gopro batteries as well as another popular 3rd party battery . highly recommended .
__label__positive__ ive like it so much that i went ahead and purchase an additional three to past out as gifts to my family and friend .
__label__negative__ case fits dmc-zs50 , and spare battery ( barely ) but not the charger or usb cable . inside pocket is to small for a spare sd card with its cover .
__label__positive__ battery works great
__label__negative__ burned in 5 minutes ! ! !
__label__positive__ these filters are fantastic ! makes my pictures look as if i knew what i was doing .
__label__positive__ extra padding for when you load up your bag - works well .
__label__negative__ i ca n't believe this was rated as highly as it is . everything about this is so cheap . the velcro and the panels all show up like eye sores in photographs . even if i could iron out the creases it still would n't be useable . really disappointed .
__label__positive__ does the job . could be clearer video but ok for the price .
__label__positive__ keeps my camera and equipment safe and well packed . great buy .
__label__negative__ i too thought i was ordering six boxes
__label__positive__ love these cameras , they work perfect on my pc
__label__positive__ excellent
__label__negative__ i used this at a small event with an omd e-m5 mark ii along with an fl-600r flash . it performs as advertised but it was incredibly flimsy and was n't able to keep the camera or the flash situated very well despite tightening them as much as i safely could . i 'd recommend just saving up to get a better bracket .
__label__positive__ works as expected .
__label__negative__ the item , while well packaged , looks nothing like the photo with the baby in it , colors are not as pastel , and has ugly grey concrete in it
__label__negative__ waste of money . 1st photo did n't shoot out . 2nd photo had double image . 3rd photo not good . 3 pics cost $ 9 just to see if it would work so i could make use of the camera . took nearly 45 minutes to see the results .
__label__positive__ camera works great . the video isa little grainy in low light . setting date and time is so easy compared to other covert cameras . the clip isa little stiff , must be careful that it does not break .
__label__positive__ great product . great price with exceptional amazon customer service .
__label__negative__ do not buy ! ! ! charge lasts for 2 minutes.. waste of money .
__label__positive__ installed it and it worked , not sure what else i can ask for .
__label__negative__ the harness broke tge first time we put it on . cheap !
__label__positive__ great item just what i was looking for .
__label__positive__ screen was a perfect replacement. < br / > a little assistance from a youtube video and fixed my camera in 15 minutes and at a fraction of the cost of taking it to a repair centre .
__label__positive__ they are loud , & never go off unless triggered . great product that does exactly what is intended to do . i got a whole bunch for around the house . x law enforcement & i think that making the bad guy 's job harder is what it 's all about . the more hassle for him , the better for you . safety first always .
__label__negative__ final update : lorex replaced my screen but i had also sent in my power cord . i have been trying since november 13 , 2015 to get a power cord so i could use the unit they sent me . so far they have closed two , tickets without comment or resolution . i have a third one in now but i do not expect and answer on this one either . so i must throw this expensive system in the trash because i can not power it . what a rip off . update : the system keeps resetting itself and i keep losing my recording times . i just viewed 8 days of recordings and the last four were not the times i had set , but a default setup because the system reset itself - again . this has occurred many times . consider another security package . original review : so far they work just fine with high quality hi-res images during the day . night recordings are , well , night vision recordings . do not expect the same detail identifiable night recordings you get with daytime recordings . the software has some glaring weaknesses but overall it does the job . the user manual is really wanting for detailed information . scheduling recordings is most confusing . it is easy to schedule recordings but there is no way to see all the schedule that you have set up . if you set up different recording times for different days of the week for each camera , you had better write them down or you will have to restore default settings and start all over again .
__label__positive__ they fit perfectly . no need to pay the high price of oem product .
__label__positive__ great picture quality at a very affordable price . easily connected to my current adt system .
__label__negative__ while this may be a good camera , we had to return it because it 's rather bulky . should 've looked closer at the pictures .
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ this camera is better than my friend 's gopro ! after i showed him my camera , he got one as well .
__label__positive__ ship fast ! great camera ! ca n't wait to use it at the beach
__label__positive__ fast shipping and just as described . fit perfectly thanks
__label__positive__ exactly what we needed and works great !
__label__positive__ it worked great and we loved the wrist strap
__label__positive__ purchased this camera for my husband . he loves it .
__label__positive__ i have two selfie-sticks but this one is , by far , my favorite . very sturdy when extended , nice foam grip , and versatile for any length extension you want . i also have used this one in the river and swimming pool , completely submerged , with no damage to it .
__label__neutral__ takes pictures well , and the zoom is great . dies in 3 minutes if you take a video .
__label__positive__ works great .easily recharges
__label__neutral__ i bought one of these at an amazon returns auction . had i spent full price i would have been really angry but the price i paid was much less and i 'm happy . these are way over priced at retail though . lets look at what you receive , the biggest item is the light , which is just a standard light with a light balanced bulb , nothing special . that light mounts to 2 legs that is somewhat adjustable with screws . attached to that mount is a plastic light bounce to push the light down . the bathtub like background is thin and in the case of my unit very easily bent , thus the apparent return as it was dented all along the top , but the background is so tall the dents have not been an issue for any of the photos i 've taken . the two easel light bounces are the cheapest things in the kit . they are just cardboard with cheap stands that attach with a peel off sticky which lasted about 5 minutes before they peeled away from the bounce . one would think at the price point full retail the bounces would have been at least foam board , but nope , just white cardboard paper which you can not clean . lots of antiques i have seem to shed a bit when i am taking their pictures and the dust makes its way to these bounces , i can dry dust , but if and i am sure there will be a stain , that 's it you ca n't use cleaner on these . this set is much , much larger than it looks and in fairness my photos do look better and the price i paid was well worth it , at full retail , i would not recommend this . the larger set is the exact same thing with two of these light bars mounted in the middle and that is the one i have . very large and equally over priced .
__label__positive__ this is a high quality tripod that is very well made . it is too big for travel , but perfect for activities that do not require a lot of transport or hiking
__label__positive__ perfect fit for my new pahntom 3 , and plenty of room for the ipad mini and extra battery .
__label__positive__ amazing- they sent it super fast
__label__positive__ strong , sturdy . and it works perfectly .
__label__positive__ great item to get and have when you go camping and the camping resorts has what i call a crappie wi-fi service . you can receive a better signal with the bullet-m2-hp . only drawback is the system does not come with instructions on how to reverse the process in order for you to go and retrieve the signal .
__label__positive__ a good product at a good price . worked will with good color and clarity .
__label__positive__ quick , fast , simple , easy
__label__negative__ way too big !
__label__positive__ excellent= does what it should . not really more to say .
__label__positive__ a little awkward to remove from the case-especially for younger users . otherwise , it 's pretty awesome .
__label__positive__ pelican has become industry standard for fragile electronics , in particular camera equipment . the case is solid , the customizable foam inside it is great
__label__positive__ controls the zoom on a hdr-cx330 , which is all i wanted it to do . that it works on three channels is a big plus , since i need remote zoom control for 2 more camcorders . requires two aaa batteries for the controller . the receiver does not appear to have a battery .
__label__positive__ i really feel more secure now that the bb2 outlet is watching my stuff . after running a few tests , i was quite impressed at the quality of the video .love the motion detection feature as it saves storage & keeps me from reviewing monotonous video . when i first opened the box , i was struck by how aesthetically pleasing this was for something that plugs into my wall . rather than stand out as some cheap plastic looking thing , it really fits into my décor . it does n't look like some faked-up thing . it looks like it belongs there . and that 's exactly what i needed , nobody knows they are being watched . the workmanship is solid , so this investment will last a long time . the instructions that came with it were actually in english ! very clear and easy to understand . it was a snap to set this up so that it could collect the videos that will help protect my property . i showed it to a friend who is looking for a way to stop the pilfering at his small business . it was like a light bulb came on in his head . he 's going to order one , so he can identify the employee and protect his assets .
__label__positive__ clarity is great . the hood can be a problem , it can go on crooked which show up in the photo
__label__positive__ fits my 6d perfectly . looks even better on it than the original piece . great purchase .
__label__positive__ just what i needed .
__label__positive__ great camera quality and value ! i opened it up and played with it for a while to try out all of the different settings . it is easy to use and takes great pictures ! i would definitely recommend this camera !
__label__positive__ so soft and nice . holds my expensive camera . looks stylish and does n't tell people what type of canon camera i have.. : d
__label__negative__ ... wide angle is blurred at the edges. < br / > disappointed with the focus. < br / > slow to zoom. < br / > scene setting comes on repeatedly and is slow to set. < br / > basically a slow snap-shooter ... < br / > : - (
__label__negative__ very difficult to hook up it would never connection to my computer or my phone . not user friendly .
__label__positive__ these cameras work great for the home . not hd but good quality . the auto adjust night feature is great . i have no complaints for the price . all around good cameras .
__label__positive__ it works and there you go .
__label__positive__ this floaty is really great ! the velcro adhesive stays on really strong to the back of the go pro and the floaty . i took it out a couple of times and it floats great and is easy to spot ! also its nicely packaged and comes with fog resistant strips  . do n't pay for the go pro floaty this one is just as good ! !
__label__positive__ great !
__label__positive__ wow , easy set up . got here on time with no damages . and i 'll be ordering another for next year as a 2nd set-up . i highly recommend this product .
__label__positive__ great camera ! ! !
__label__negative__ i did n't receive exactly as what shown and described , the dual battery charger replaced with a single battery charger . the wall charger which has 2 usb slots is not included . the usb cable not included . more description about what i received can be shown in the attached photo .
__label__positive__ great product ! ! !
__label__positive__ came quickly in the mail ! adorable ; thanks !
__label__positive__ it 's not as sturdy as i thought it would be but it 's compact and easily fits in a backpack or even pockets . i would not recommend this for & # 34 ; fablets & # 34 ; like the iphone 6 plus or notes .
__label__positive__ very pleased with the camera so far .
__label__positive__ i love this lens ! excellent quality for the price ( or even if it were priced higher ) . i immediately put the uv filter on . i have n't experimented with the other filters yet , but i will . for the other accesories , let 's face it , the teeny tripod will never hold up a canon eos ( at least not a 7d ) but i can use it for my backup & # 34 ; point-and-shoot & # 34 ; camera . same with the cleaning kit . probably wo n't use it on the canon , but may on the backup . shipping was quick and the packaging was appropriate for what we being sent .
__label__positive__ easy to use and great photos
__label__positive__ i use the things i need and store the rest for when i do need them .
__label__positive__ who does n't love cheap filters ! the only reason i use a filter is to protect the lens . i do n't really rely on filters for color quality or anything else . i do n't really care about the thickness because that 's just aesthetics. < br / > < br / > when looking for a filter , you want something that stays on and protects you lens and wont cost you half the price of a new lens ( the expensive stuff runs around $ 300+ ... . jeez ! ) < br / > < br / > this gets the job done. < br / > < br / > the first one i got was shakey , when you shook it , you could hear the glass move . i just went on amazon and requested an exchange and got a good quality filter in the next two days ! awesome service , amazon .
__label__positive__ it so cute .
__label__positive__ i 've been a photographer for over 45 years , owning many cameras . this is a wonderful camera . it does virtually everything that the high-end models do , at one-tenth the price .
__label__positive__ does just what its supposed to do
__label__positive__ i had one of these on my 24/70 lens and thank god ! ! i dropped it flat on the lens/filter during a wedding ! it shattered.. but just the filter ! ! ! it saved my lens ! ! so i replaced it with another on asap ! if i would have had a cheap ol filter on there my lens would not have made it ! ! i 'm sure the lens would have been shattered as well ! ! so if you want to protect your lenses buy a great filter ! ! !
__label__negative__ i had to return this item . one of the closures did not snap into place .
__label__positive__ looks like the nikon original , minus the nikon sticker . seems to work just fine . i bought to have a charged battery in standby
__label__positive__ so many accessories come with this camera for any situation ! also my gopro accessories work with this camera as well !
__label__positive__ my wife loves using this lens , as far as good .
__label__positive__ i already owned a sony cyber-shot 20x zoom . i really loved it , but wanted a bit more\\ '' zoom\\ '' so , since i was familiar with the sony i decided on the 50x zoom . wow ! ! ! ! ! ! it is so cool ! ! ! ! it has features on it that i did not know it had , so many options ! ! ! watercolor , b & w , sepia , one feature makes things look like a coloring book ! ! ! ! i love this camera ! ! ! ! !
__label__negative__ the film we got was outdated in 2008 pleas give me my money back
__label__positive__ this selfie stick came just as pictured .works great with my iphone 5s syncs to bluetooth feature .perfect for traveling and being packed away as its compact size allows for easy storage ! zoom feature is awesome .takes great group pictures i recommend this product .
__label__positive__ easy to use although it is bigger than i wanted . i also have not yet tried to look at any pictures on my mac . i am hoping it will work with a mac . i have n't yet had the & # 34 ; opportunity & # 34 ; to use the camera for the purpose i bought it for .
__label__positive__ so far , so good . the only trick is figuring out how to set up all of the physical components of the alarm from the youtube videos and using common sense . the manual only covers programming the alarm .
__label__positive__ great product , i just personally do not have a use for it
__label__positive__ good canon xti replacement battery . 200+ shots on the first charge and still showed almost 1/2 charge .
__label__positive__ works like a nikon coolpix should 😏
__label__positive__ everything you need for a go pro is here .
__label__positive__ best little accessory for your dslr . i bought this use for taking photos of the fireworks on july 4th and it has not come off my camera since . easy to use and no setup or software needed . it has a nice long cord and is lightweight and easy to store . worth every penny when you need clear shots .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ good product .
__label__positive__ fast delivery and it works great , i love the wireless remote for flash and wireless trigger for the cameras remote shooting ...
__label__positive__ works very well
__label__positive__ you can see the light good
__label__positive__ works well
__label__positive__ work great , nice packing .
__label__positive__ this is a tool i should have bought years ago ! ! this has saved me hours of cursing and scratched lens rings..
__label__positive__ thank you so much for putting this beauty into my hands at such a great price . i love it ! !
__label__positive__ all ok
__label__negative__ poor quality all the way around vision is blurry and the audio pretty much do n't work unless you 're right on it ! ! but you get what you pay 4. : - ! : -\
__label__positive__ nice size for easy use . much better than those you get with your average cleaning kit 's which tend to be too small and make it easy to smudge what you just cleaned .
__label__positive__ enjoy the camera , takes very good pix , however before using it , you must < br / > read the & # 34 ; 89 page manual & # 34 ; or it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. < br / > < br / > sure , you can & # 34 ; snap a picture & # 34 ; without reading the manual , but this little camera is < br / > full of surprises , but you need to peruse the manual , futzing with the buttons < br / > is n't going to cut it , believe me ! that 's why i have the & # 34 ; manual & # 34 ; on my favorites tab. < br / > < br / > still have n't figured out how to take a delay time picture , to get & # 34 ; me in the picture & # 34 ; but perhaps the rest of the < br / > manual will have that information. < br / > < br / > wishing now that i had purchased the silver tone , as the tiny lettering on the red camera is extremely difficult to read < br / > especially in less than optimum lighting conditions .
__label__positive__ received this head by mistake instead of their k-20x ballhead , but the quality was great , so actually ordered this with a sirui monopod . looks to be a great value compared to my rss mh01 and mh02 heads . i 'm not a fan of using a ball head on a monopod , as i 'm usually holding the monopod/camera with one hand and releasing the head with the other . i do n't want a ballhead to 'flop ' over . i do n't need pan on a mono , i could never hold it perfect , usually just up and down tilt . i 've not exactly determined how i would use it , but the bottom of this head fits into an arca plate
__label__positive__ has all the screws needed for my phantom 2 . i had stripped s few and needed some replacements . this pack had them all .
__label__neutral__ this stabilizer is not bad . it works for the most part . however there are a few minor issues that , even at this price point , can be solved by using another product. < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > balancing : this is my first such stabilizer , and after a few tutorials and a few tries i found balancing it was really not too hard . so points for that ! < br / > construction : feels solid , and if not for the few issues below i 'd have no issue. < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > < br / > - the sliding plates are not terribly hard to use , but a screw-type adjustment would be great . the neweer unit is only a few bucks more than this but has the screw-type adjustments , which should be much easier than the loosen-tap-tighten-check method used for the opteka . i have n't received that one yet but will write a review < br / > < br / > - the little plastic collar that holds the screw used for extending/retracting the weight platform does not inspire confidence . technically it works but it looks out of place on an otherwise well constructed ( mostly ) unit . generally feels sloppy and not like it will last too long . opteka must agree since they included a spare. < br / > < br / > - the grip slips around on the handle , and this is pretty annoying . it 's also not the most comfortable to hold . easy enough to solve with a different grip and/or some superglue , but eh ... < br / > < br / > - the biggest problem by far for a product like this : the bearings . the bearings are ok for the main pivot ( if you were to spin the camera around while holding the handle stationary ) but i ca n't really make one walk around it without inducing some moderate spin . that 's no big thing really , but the two pivots on either side of the & # 34 ; yoke & # 34 ; - that y-shaped piece ( look like silver buttons on either side of the main pivot ) are evidently not on bearings , and are too tight . they cause an otherwise well balanced platform to tilt quite severely with even small movements on these pivots . this is a no-go for any shots where you are moving the camera up/down . evenwhile walking around trying to hold it steady , there will invariably be some movement and it will cause the camera to get a-swingin ' . for instance if i start with the camera around eye level and then lower the stabilizer , by the time i 'm at hip level the camera has tilted forward about 30 degrees . this is n't a balance issue , it 's the stiff pivots. < br / > < br / > i could loosen them , lube them , maybe even put proper bearings in there . for now i 'm returning this one and going for the neewer with easier adjustability up top . hopefully the pivots are better on that one ...
__label__positive__ the manual says the battery provides up to 16 hours of recording . this must be on the low res mode . i only get up to 2 hours on hd . besides that , the picture is great . image stabilizer works great . i wear it on my motorcycle helmet and the image is smooth and stable even on bumpy roads . the smart phone app is pretty sweet , so you can see the picture on your phone ( needs wifi to work ) . i recommend it for a helmet cam over a go-pro since it 's a slim profile and half the cost .
__label__negative__ i mean overall i guess you get what you pay for cause this is a great price for a touch screen camera , but picture quality is a joke. < br / > 16.2mp lol
__label__positive__ love this set up . i received everything as i expected , although i read some reviews that said everything was poor quality , i was happy with everything i received . the tripod will soon be replaced with a higher quality , but for the price of this package , i am extremely happy with the set up ... now to figure out how to use the thing !
__label__positive__ my boyfriend & i love this camera ! i got it for him as a gift , but i use it just as much as he does ! the photos always turn out great & it does n't suck the life out of batteries ! !
__label__positive__ this is simply the best premium compact of 2015 . 16fps burst mode and high frame rate capture were the main selling points for me . image quality is only slightly better than the rx100iii but auto focus is noticeably faster . depth of field is decent although it wo n't compete with a dslr in that department . the video capabilites are fantastic . 1080p recording is the best ive seen in this price range . 4k recording is limited to mere 5 minute clips . i did n't buy thus for 4k video but perhaps sony can improve that in firmware in the future . accessories for the rx100 series will fit . i currently own the sony premium leather case , grip and the hard screen protector and fyi , the case wo n't fit with the grip attached .
__label__positive__ great quality .
__label__positive__ works as expected and received what i expected . the packaging is n't very eco-friendly . each cloth is wrapped in plastic and then all the clothes are wrapped in an outer plastic .
__label__positive__ works great with my camera
__label__positive__ very high quality , fits great , amazing fast shipping .
__label__positive__ what a wonderful camera i love it .
__label__positive__ i had a phantom 1 before this and it was such a pain . so after selling that and getting this one , it was a huge difference . the quality is amazing the 4k video looks movie grade . overall this is a must by .
__label__negative__ did n't fit for the camera . epic fail .
__label__negative__ charger did n't work . plan to send it back . very disappointed .
__label__positive__ actually works ... .its a fun toy !
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ i love my jvc camcorder let 's me record my favorite shows !
__label__positive__ great camera , in automatic it´s very easy to use . if you take time to learn the features you can take geat pictures everywhere . great , but carefull with the plastic of the visor .
__label__positive__ good products
__label__positive__ i am an average amateur photographer . i read the reviews and did some product research before i purchased this . i like the features that are built in and they serve my needs and work perfectly . this flash syncs with my camera flawlessly . the price is right and the quality and performance are right up there too .
__label__positive__ very useful . fair price .
__label__negative__ you get what you pay for with this product . i got it because it was much less expensive than the canon version . it is lightweight and made out of cheep materials . the ring is plastic , not metal and when i screwed my tripod plate into the ring , the hole is too shallow which basically makes it useless . it is unfortunate that the canon version is so expensive but this product is n't worth buying for any price .
__label__positive__ the price was perfect for what this is .
__label__positive__ really love it ! bought it for an overseas trip . easy to pack and carry . easy to set up and use .
__label__positive__ excellent product ! ! !
__label__negative__ i did not buy this
__label__positive__ the description did n't say that the cord was about 3 feet , but this is a good length . the remote does n't require batteries and seems well built . the little pouch that foto & tech seemed like a good idea , but it is just a little too small .
__label__positive__ very convenient and space is generous . compartments are perfect and hold everything i need !
__label__positive__ the center section of the page meant for captions is a real pain because the paper is inside the plastic and also attached to the binder . so you have to open the binder to get the paper out . it is difficult to push the paper back in after you have written on it . paper is thin and very hard to get back in . too much time and effort to do that .
__label__positive__ good quality lenses . they do the job .
__label__positive__ when you buy sony you do n't have to worry .
__label__positive__ great lens that is very versatile .
__label__positive__ we have multiple of these throughout our house . they take a little time to set up , but once they do we can access them from anywhere . occasionally we have to reboot them to get them to reconnect , but not too often . note : if you do get these and install them please change the generic access login and password . that is how hackers can get in .
__label__positive__ it is what it is , great material great price
__label__positive__ we love this sensor ! there are many benefits for our family ... with a young child it gives another level of peace . if he opens the door when i go to the restroom , i will know about it ! we are able to monitor our pet care when we are out of town . it also allows us added security ! we just get an alert on our phone when the door is open or shut . simple and genius ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ so much fun . takes a beating and keeps flying when learning . handles fairly well outside for being small . video image is better than expected . even came with xd card- nice surprise
__label__positive__ great for taking wildlife shots .
__label__negative__ it doesn ' comes with the the manual to use it . i will returns asap
__label__positive__ i have n't had the camera long but it has met all my expectations and then some . i am especially thrilled to have the 55-200mm lens which allows me to take up close photos of nature . i am very happy so far with the camera .
__label__neutral__ ok , made it work
__label__positive__ works well
__label__positive__ works great . we take the battery off after sun . am service and it 's ready to roll again by pm .
__label__negative__ went dead before i could even use them . they need to be uses as soon as they arrive .
__label__positive__ great case . pelican or nothing .
__label__positive__ works as described and is awesome for the price . do n't waste your money on overly expensive camera flashes
__label__positive__ very good microfiber cleaning cloths , it also has some paper to clean the lens front & back element . the blower seems to hold nicely though i rarely use it . the pen brush sheds too much , would not recommend using it .
__label__negative__ the battery would n't stay in . i had to use packing tape to keep it in place for charging . also , the battery was not the same specifications that was listed in the product description . it did not hold a charge for as long as described . very cheaply made .
__label__positive__ very satisfied with samsung shs-2920. < br / > easy to install and works very fast .
__label__positive__ products are the same quality as the originals . however , these come at a very affordable price that everyone can afford . would n't hesitate to buy again if i get another gopro .
__label__positive__ used camera for wedding trip . diving to 55 ' and everyday ocean shots in and out of water . proved reliable and well built . small dent in front , but cosmetic dent ( hard to see unless light reflects just right ) is one i would find from everyday use . no marring otherwise and camera worked as expected . good camera with great features was the go to camera on trip with faster lens for evening shots did better than my super zoom . ended up using this camera for majority of wedding photos in vivid mode for strong colors . recommend this camera highly .
__label__positive__ great handy little product !
__label__positive__ thank you very much excellent work
__label__positive__ works great , it brought life back to my older gopro hero 2 and the batteries last much longer than the original .
__label__positive__ a nice alternative to the more expensive gopro version .
__label__positive__ exellent
__label__positive__ great upgrade with folding shade , and this monitor is slim , light and crystal clear picture for fpv set up.. i ve got what i was expecting for the price.. aloha
__label__positive__ good product
__label__positive__ good product . have been using these for a few years with no problems so far
__label__positive__ pretty cool little camera . have setup to see front driveway and front entrance . sets up easily with apple router
__label__positive__ i am a big fan of case logic cases . i have purchased many of them over the years and have never been disappointed . they use premium quality materials , and assembly and quality control has been good ( i 've never received a defective case ) . the designs are interesting and nearly always work well . this case is no exception . it 's a solid 5 stars for quality , functionality and value. < br / > < br / > the design here gives you 4 & # 34 ; compartments & # 34 ; using padded dividers with velcro ( as usual in camera cases ) . although i envisioned using it with my drift camera ( a small go-pro style device ) , now that i have it , i see that you could remove one of the dividers and easily use this with many compact cameras and have plenty of room for the charger , cards , cables and other stuff you need to carry along . it has the usual net pockets on the top flap for cards and other small , slim items , also a large zippered interior pocket on the same top flap perfect for larger slim items , such as maps , printed manuals , and so on . there 's also a carrying handle on top , of course. < br / > < br / > the bottom compartment is about 2 1/4 inches deep x 5 1/4 x 8 inches ( rounded off ) . you have one long and two short dividers to use as you see fit or you can remove them all and fit in a much larger device . this design makes this case *very* flexible and i can see adapting it for many different devices , not just go-pro style cameras. < br / > < br / > it also has a very nice rubberized hard bottom so you can sit this down anywhere without worries when you need to get to your gear . very nice and great if you are out on a rainy day . as with all case logic cases , the zippers are strong and have nice tabs to make them easy to pull open or close. < br / > < br / > the case comes with a 25 year & # 34 ; quality guarantee & # 34 ; -- yes , they believe in their product ! < br / > < br / > this case is so good , flexible , and usable that i can see myself purchasing quite a few of these over time . it 's nearly perfect , in my estimation , and i think anyone who gets it will be pleased with it.nk anyone who gets it will be pleased with it .
__label__positive__ great 'lil light , fast service ... .exceeded expectations !
__label__positive__ i got the adapter on time . the adapter is working well . naum portnoy
__label__positive__ this camera has a manufacturing defect for sony was replaced by very good service warranty < br / > very satisfied with the product
__label__positive__ accurate lightweight good quality
__label__negative__ broken piece , could not hold the spring . returned .
__label__positive__ try to measure the lcd first before you buy any .
__label__positive__ i purchased this kit as someone completely new to nikon . sure , this kit is a serious chunk of change , but you do save several hundred dollars purchasing the kit compared to each item individually . i had even gone so far as to price out each component if they were used , and buying the kit brand new was still a better deal . if you 're already heavily invested in nikon bodies and lenses , this probably is n't for you unless you need multiple setups. < br / > < br / > out of the box , you 're supplied with everything you need to start shooting photos or video except for memory cards/recording media . you 'll need to purchase some fast sd cards for the d750 because the kit does not supply you with one . also , the atomos ninja does not include recording media , so you 'll need to purchase your own ssd or hdd if you want to use it. < br / > < br / > the 3 supplied prime lenses are top notch . they 're the perfect starter set and much higher quality than your typical kit lens that 's usually slower and made of cheaper components . naturally , while the included primes are fantastic and an important part of any photographer 's kit , you 'll probably want to build up a lens collection custom to your needs and wants . the items included in the kit are more of a barebones setup for video too . so , while this kit will provide the camera and decent external recording device , you 'll still need the rest of the support gear that comes with the dslr territory. < br / > < br / > there are plenty of reviews about the d750 itself , so i 'll skip all of that here . for people interested in purchasing the film maker 's kit , it 's a great collection of the basics .
__label__positive__ bought this for my wife for our anniversary . she loves taking pictures and was wanting some additional accessories for her camera . this is a great set , has tons and tons of different accessories she can use . she has tried many of them and told me they work great and you ca n't beat this kit for the price .
__label__positive__ fulfilling all expectations , very happy with the choice .
__label__positive__ one of my best investments ever . to start on the world of digital slr photography , this is it and much more..
__label__positive__ we kept buying new battery 's for the nikon p500 thinking they were bad , it turned out the charger in the camera was not working . but thanks to the charger we got from you its working great , its just to bad we were throwing good battery 's all good know thanks
__label__positive__ needed this for my camera . great
__label__positive__ you just ca n't beat this deal ! my batteries work perfectly , no problem shooting a full day of my son 's baseball tournaments . i highly recommend product and seller .
__label__positive__ this piece of equipment was much more stout than i anticipated . it does everything i need it to do . no complaints so far . the only thing i 'm concerned with is the zipper on the carrying case . it seems very cheap and i think if not zipped very gently and carefully it will fail . but all of these less expensive items are like this . if you baby them properly , not tighten things down as tight as you can etc , i believe they will last just fine . for the money , you ca n't beat it .
__label__positive__ i have been looking for a new tripod and found a really fun easy easily transportable flexible tripod with bluetooth ! this is really fun tripod because it 's light and you can take it anywhere and place it just about on any surface like a fence , handle , or it can stand alone on any hard surface. < br / > < br / > plus everyone knows that selfie sticks are all the rage , so you can stand the legs straight and even use this tripod as a selfie stick . the legs are bendable so you can bend them around just about anything . we have a gro pro as well but i used this tripod when shooting a product review with my iphone . it worked great and was very easy to set up and use. < br / > < br / > i know periscope is the new thing and this tripod is great for those types of videos . so you do n't have to be a blogger or photographer to use this tripod , if you love shooting videos or chatting on periscope , this is a great product. < br / > < br / > my kids also love watching netflix on my phone so i let them watch it every now and again and set it up on the tripod so no one fights about who gets to hold it or no one gets tired of holding it because it sits nicely on the tripod .
__label__positive__ this item is really great , i use it for 24 hour surveillance of the outdoor cameras .
__label__positive__ exactly what i needed . great price . works as advertised .
__label__positive__ awesome product .
__label__negative__ worked for one hour..then died .
__label__neutral__ i did n't realize the camera was so small
__label__positive__ got to love gopro . i recently lost my old hero 3 black , and found this one as cheap as it could get . all items arrived as described , it was just as new . great photo and video quality .
__label__negative__ not good ! ! ! can see black ring around your picture ! !
__label__positive__ was taking photo 's of large photo 's at the ann arbor art fair and the photo 's look like i was taking the photo . i just placed it in focus with the large photo and it work . simple operation and image stabilization really works well .
__label__positive__ i love it . i am really happy with it because it came on time and my daughter loves it ! ! ! she enjoys takeing pics of her guinea pig to
__label__negative__ there were no instructions included and we never could get it to focus correctly . maybe it 's just our incompetence , but it is sitting on a shelf . thank you for your interest .
__label__positive__ great case .
__label__positive__ this lens hood works perfectly on my canon ef-s 18-55mm is ll ( non-stm ) lens . it has four bayonet lips where the new stm lens has only two . order a ew-63c hood for the stm . just turn the hood over and twist on for storage . ca n't beat the price or the service .
__label__positive__ this is a great digital photo frame . i bought it to compile photos for my best friend 's 60th birthday . easy to use and add music to . the instructions for setup are super easy. < br / > i had to return one without the stand and they promptly sent me another , no questions asked. < br / > the picture quality is awesome and the sound is as good as my computer speakers ... maybe better . i like that it has a motion sensor so it can turn off at the time you specify and go on when someone enters the room . i have and older digital photo frame ( not a nix ) that continuously runs and i can not turn off , unless i shut it down , which means it will probably burn out at some point . i would definitely recommend this to a friend !
__label__positive__ item delivered on time , was as described
__label__positive__ excellent quality . use it to keep my b & w 120 film .
__label__positive__ i originally bought an 8 inch nixplay to try out 2 weeks ago . i liked this frame so much , i went out an purchased the top of the line nixplay 's frame ( nixplay pro series 18.5 inch wifi cloud frame ) and gave my 8 inch frame to my parents with all 1500 pictures i put into it . it is awesome how i created my own nixplay email and i can email the frames any new picture of the family i take instantly . now , my wife is asking for me to send my mother in law a frame too . both my parents and mother in law are not very computer literate but by me being able to control their frames , everyone is happy seeing thousands of pictures of their grandchildren from birth to the present.these frames end the calls telling me that & # 34 ; grandma needs more pictures of the kids since they are growing so fast & # 34 ; .
__label__negative__ this item was too large for my gopro hero 4 . it is sized closer for a gopro hero 2 .
__label__neutral__ the attached photo was taken with a canon 6d , 24mm 1.4l , 1/1600 , f1.6 , iso 100 . the image is blurry and dark at the edges . this filter is completely unacceptable at the wide f stops . if i stopped down to f2.8 , the image would probably have been usable , but the thing that kills the versatility for me is that it always cuts out some degree of light . it never goes completely clear as i was hoping , which means i found myself removing it in lower light situations . i was hoping that i could leave this filter on all the time , but as you can see by my results , that was not an option .
__label__positive__ its really small i love it , easy menu and take good pictures for the price
__label__negative__ the camera worked but the application has a driver failed and would not zoom . i went to the web site and nothing was available . i can not recommend this .
__label__negative__ my camera broke in right under one year so they did not honor the warranty . leaked water and i had only used it three times ! sorely disappointed in their customer service . i could also never get the pictures to transmit wirelessly and the customer service center even sent me a different sd card blaming it on the memory card . buyer beware ! ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ worked inside and outside of car during normal and off road driving . takes a little practice to get the angle you want , but is relatively easy to install . just be sure to have a smooth surface ; i had just a small part on a textured surface and it eventually shook off .
__label__negative__ the film only works at night time . very disappointed .
__label__positive__ easy to fly . a great starter quad-copter . the camera is a fun option . stay away from trees . got it stuck but fished it out . so fun to fly ! !
__label__positive__ have n't tested all the items yet . battery and charger work . card reader is of cheap construction , pretty much worthless . bags are made ok . still a killer deal
__label__positive__ great tripod for i-phone . works well with 6 plus
__label__positive__ excellent lens for the money ; the accessory kit was a nice bonus .
__label__positive__ so far , works simply and automatically . it would n't load all the jpegs from an sd card , but when i transferred them to a flashdrive , they were all displayed . unless it has a short working life , this is a good deal .
__label__positive__ works great on my pentax k-50
__label__positive__ very nice camera , works great . thank you .
__label__positive__ batteries work fine , and was a quick ship , no complaints
__label__positive__ perfect , flawless solution for cleaning lenses . now i see why is the movie industry standard for that job .
__label__positive__ replaced a broken one . superb service . good tripod to travel with .
__label__positive__ excellent second flash to use with my canon flash systems .
__label__positive__ works great for a fraction of the price of the orion brand .
__label__positive__ the camera cleaning kit that was purchased arrived promptly and is exactly what i want .
__label__negative__ put in a new micro card , ca n't get product to work at this time . been trouble shooting for a week now and i 've tried everything ( yes , including the reset button . ) do n't see any way to reach out to the company for customer service . wishful thinking i know .
__label__positive__ excelent product
__label__positive__ it is a replacement for my other s5100 camera that the battery compartment broke on . it is exactly like it . i can use the lens & cards from the other camera . the lettering is not worn off as it is on mine !
__label__positive__ terrific product ! the black side is a light absorbing velour , which was an unexpected surprise ! the white side is a lot more opaque than on a previous purchase with fotodiox 's 5'x7 ' . however , this does not seem to measure the 7 ' as indicated , but the fabric quality it great ! i will continue to buy studiopro backdrops as i believe there is consistency of quality in their products . that said . . . it would have been nice to get a full measurement of 5'x7 ' though . . . every inch counts when you 're advertising 5'x7 's studiopro - this was the only disappointment as fotodiox was a true 5'x7 ' . on fotodiox 's backdrop , the black was showing the white side making the white appear grey . . . this is why i returned fotodiox and bought studiopro . good quality , decent price . after a ton of purchases and returns after reviews of product , i would definitely highly recommend studiopro !
__label__positive__ a great inexpensive manual flash .
__label__negative__ bought this & # 34 ; guardian accessory & # 34 ; gc43 camera to use with my udr744 guardian system . the camera was needed to fit in a confined location . i tried to pair the camera to my system , but it failed repeatedly . i called the uniden customer service number and a very nice lady informed me that this guardian camera was incompatible with my guardian system . the cameras that came with the system are the only ones that are currently available for the udr744 . the camera is on its way back to amazon .
__label__positive__ excellent ! ! !
__label__positive__ outstanding ! clear and close focussing . really nice all around instrument .
__label__positive__ works great . what else would you expect from tiffen ?
__label__positive__ very happy so far . for the price , these seem to be a very good value . only used them a couple of times but worked easily .
__label__positive__ this is the best price you 're going to get for film in bulk !
__label__positive__ the tripod works as advertised . no height adjustment . sturdy .
__label__negative__ it 's a good deal if you are looking for a starter camera . the issue i have with the product is the grainy image on the preview screen.i had an older version of this camera and it was awesome . next time i will definitely go with a better model .
__label__neutral__ went to samys to purchase this lens they had tax free sale . crystal clear image great light entry solid feel . was looking forward to this . but straight out the box the lens did n't work on two different cameras . wanted to give them a shot but quality control skipped on this one .
__label__positive__ took this on my cruise and it worked amazing ! < br / > < br / > went into the ocean in the bahamas . there was so much sand it was crazy but it did not affect the camera . just had to follow the cleaning instructions it came with. < br / > < br / > also took it snuba diving and recorded video while also taking pics . it was so awesome ! i love watching the videos from it. < br / > < br / > i 've also taken it in the freezing cold when i went tubing , again with no issues ! < br / > < br / > if you follow the instructions , clean it as it says , make sure your 're closing the battery chamber without debris it will have no issues . it 's nice not to have to worry about a camera and actually enjoy whatever it is you 're doing !
__label__positive__ ordered these to use with leica 8x32 ba . they fit great .
__label__positive__ love this digital camera . very easy to use with lots of auto settings . takes high quality stills and video . highly recommend this camera .
__label__positive__ i am in love with this lens . no more switching between lenses . only down side it 's fairly heavier then stock lenses but it 's also bigger . i have a sony a330 stock lenses are 55mm and this is a 62mm so there is a bit of size different which would account for the weight . very happy with it and recommend tamron lenses to other photography people
__label__positive__ i have n't installed the unit yet , and probably wo n't until next fall . ( like , november )
__label__negative__ threads were so badly created during manufacturing , the thing wo n't work at all . total junk from day one .
__label__positive__ already have done 500 slides . works like a charm . some work is needed for post processing but anything digital is easier..
__label__positive__ excellent
__label__positive__ this tripod is perfect ! compact ( check ) light ( check ) holds a professional body with zoom lens ( check ) < br / > i use this with my canon 6d with the canon 24-105l lens . i would not recommend using it fully extended with this set up but if you do n't extend the head all the way out and use the weight hook on the bottom this thing is sturdy . i would n't leave it unattended in high winds . this is the perfect travel tripod . fits in just about any bag and the ball head grips very tight no slipping . i use it for my milky way shots when i 'm backpacking and any type of travel . i 'm headed to vietnam for two weeks and this bad boy is coming with me . you ca n't go wrong with this it 's only $ 80 a fraction of the cost of other competitors . good job amazon
__label__positive__ everything works great ! i 've used the 3m mounts , chestie , head mount , brackets , etc on my sea doo , while go-karting and more and it all works as good as the go pro brand for a fraction of the cost . the bag is perfect for holding all the extra mounts . nice package deal !
__label__positive__ pelican products are the best products to protect anything valuable to you. < br / > these are priced great other places charge way more
__label__positive__ great product , very fast shipping
__label__positive__ works great . easy to attach . there is a very small amount of darkness at the very edges of a rectangular photo . picture clarity is very good . the added weight makes it somewhat difficult to hold the phone steady . all in all a very inexpensive way to add a telephoto lens to your phone . i highly recommend .
__label__positive__ amateur photographers toy
__label__positive__ i lost my camera
__label__negative__ not what we expected for the money we paid . can only see a very short distance .
__label__positive__ so glad they offer pages to expand your album . so far i have expanded 2x and room for more if i need too .
__label__positive__ works great , windows 10 has support for biometrics and this works perfectly . when setting it up windows tells you to slide your finger , do n't . place it on the pad and lift it straight off . do fingers on both hands and more than one in case you get a cut or the like .
__label__positive__ as advertised . does the job .
__label__negative__ bought it for my canon vixia hf r600 . just used it for the first time , and there is a really high pitched noise on playback . i was finally finished with important stuff i needed to film , and now it 's not usable and i have to tape again tomorrow with a different mic . maybe mine is faulty , but i 'm very disappointed .
__label__positive__ this is a great lighting kit . so easy to use.well made .
__label__positive__ this is much bigger than i thought it would be ( over one foot tall ) , but it is very sturdy . i have n't had much of a chance to use it yet , but did hang my canon eos rebel t1 with tamron 18-270mm lens upside down from a door frame with it !
__label__positive__ nice quality
__label__positive__ fit my camera perfect ,
__label__positive__ great again and again ! !
__label__positive__ excellent bundle at a good price . everything came exactly as described , though not as pictured . for some reason the pictured bundle includes extra items like a battery charger and tripod which were not included . the camera seems to accept the non-sony battery without a problem . the memory card was a sony class 10 card , as described , and the filters and cleaning supplies were a nice addition to round out the bundle . considering the camera with the 2 lenses is the same price at most stores , this bundle is a good value . the extras are n't top quality ( except for the memory card ) but they are essentially free and are very usable .
__label__positive__ it good
__label__positive__ perfect fit for lumix lx-100 . classic .
__label__positive__ works good so far !
__label__positive__ great lens , i forgot that it weighs as much as my 70-200 , only shorter , much slower
__label__positive__ i purchased this and have been very impressed . i also had to purchase a hot shoe adapter which i must thank amazon for having both at a much better price than my local brick and mortar electronics store . i also appreciated that both items were prime . the unit is extremely quick to charge up and was able to sinc to my camera without any issues . i have no problems recommending this item and this seller .
__label__negative__ cheap , cheap cheap ! ! !
__label__positive__ so far so good with the camera , it 's cheap and pics are alright , have n't tried video yet but seems like it would be good . battery life is an issue as you 'll get maybe :90 , i would buy a spare battery or two for long trips . one issue i 've had is the app works great to record and mirror but but after i record i ca n't view from my iphone , anyone else have that issue if so please let me know if you have resolved if that works it 's an easy 5 stars . when i purchased this item though it was the 15 not 20 accessories update took this out surfing recorded in 1080p looks great , as far as the app sometimes it works sometimes it does n't , worst case scenario you just fill up the memory card then upload on your computer then email it to yourself and save it simple , worth the hassle if you wan na save $ 300 vs go pro
__label__positive__ this is a really well-made little attachment . the metal work is really nice , and clamps perfectly around my road bar near the stem . no movement of the camera after its tightened down , which seems contrary to what other posters are saying - the tolerance at the attachment point is perfect . i did use a touch of blue loctite on the two screws though just to prevent it coming loose
__label__positive__ works great .
__label__negative__ the cables had the wrong description on them . the website description was what i was seeking . the packaging description was different describing a different cable - charging rather then video to computer . very confusing . the cable in the package is for video to computer and not charging as on the package label . i will use the cable and trust dcables correct the label least other customers equally become confused . god bless .
__label__negative__ bought 3 cameras ; two came with chinese language setup . useless . going back . bought this same camera previously and had no problems . the night vision exceeds the distance listed ( 50 meters ) .
__label__negative__ pros : + very easy set up . + has survived outdoors ( under an awning with no weather casing ) for more than a year in extreme conditions . + works with all ip camera software i 've tried so far including ispy and webcamxp ( on win 7 and 10 ) . cons : - not powered directly through ethernet . - big problem : anytime the cameras sensor is exposed to any light remotely bright ( ie ; sidewalk on a sunny day ) the camera freezes and reboots . this is not an isolated problem and has yet to be fixed . do yourself a favor and find another option for the money . update august 22 , 2015 : i updated the firmware as requested , and the camera still freezes and reboots when the camera sees a bright light . i can not and will not ever recommend this camera until foscam decides to do the right thing and recall of these cameras that are affected and replace them free of charge . there is no reason this should happen .
__label__positive__ my daughter 's graduation pictures came out beautifully and it arrived on time , you saved the day and beautiful memories for me and my family thank you .
__label__positive__ this is a well-made , well padded case for small cameras like the go-pro . for that camera , some may even find the case too big , as there is more than enough room for many accessories . it is about the circumference of a medium-sized notebook , about 2 1/2 & # 34 ; deep , with velcro dividers in the bottom compartment , a mesh lining divided into three sections of varying widths on the inside of the lid and a convenient zippered pouch behind it. < br / > < br / > this would be good to take on a trip , packing in a suitcase or in a vehicle . it is more for storage , though , than for use & # 34 ; in the field & # 34 ; since -- mystifyingly -- it does not have a shoulder strap or even a way to attach one of your own . this is a surprising oversight , because many of us like to carry cases that way , particularly for action cameras. < br / > < br / > there are already many reviews here ( as well as the product description itself ) showing how well this bag suits the go pro and similar cameras if you want . i 'm attaching two photos to show another possible use for it as a lens storage case for a dslr or mirrorless camera . ( my fuji x-a1 will fit in with one or the other of these lenses but then the other can not be stored ) . the lenses here are the xf35mm and the xf18-135mm , included so you can get an idea of the sizes . the items in the upper pockets -- a memory card , an extra battery and a 62mm filter -- are only included to give an idea of the size of this case . if i had the lenses stored in it , as you can see they bow up a little , which is not a problem when you zip it up , but means nothing can go in the top compartments if you 're storing lenses below. < br / > < br / > the back of this case is a nice , thick rubber material that will resist water . the whole thing altogether is very lightweight and convenient ( except for that missing shoulder strap ) .
__label__negative__ i can take better pictures with my original sony lens than using this piece of glass .
__label__positive__ product arrived quickly . batteries work great in my samsung camera . the charger & 2 spare batteries give me more options than just plugging in my camera and waiting for a recharge . order from this company . you will be pleased and amused . : )
__label__positive__ works great .
__label__positive__ fast delivery , works perfect !
__label__positive__ i purchased these about two weeks ago and have used them for cleaning eyeglasses , camera lenses , camera lcds , and computer screens , for which they performed exceptionally . i have loaned two to other photographers that i work with , and they are very complimentary of them as well . this is a great product and i will be getting more when i lose the rest of them .
__label__positive__ no issues ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ good battery last a long time
__label__negative__ it got to me in a timely fashion , so that was good , but my only problem is the botton you push to take the picture is very hard to push and sometime it dont work at all , i gave them out as gifts and my friends are having the same problem , what do i do ?
__label__positive__ very good quality rotary trimmer . sturdy and well made . i purchased this item to upgrade my plastic trimmer & to cut heavy cardstock in mass quantity , acetate , yupo , craft plastic & chipboard . this cutter will replace my plastic cutter & a heavier duty cutter that i was considering . now i only need one rotary trimmer instead of 2 because this trimmer can cut a wider range of items . so far i have only tested it on mixed media paper but i do not think i will have a problem with the other types of material i plan on cutting for mixed media projects . the pamphlet that comes with the trimmer gives you a list of parts , website for maintenance kits etc . very helpful . although artists & crafts would appreciate this product , it can be used for a variety of tasks . highly recommended & has the longest warranty for a trimmer to my knowledge .
__label__negative__ this lens is not crisp , even at f/3.5 ! i ca n't believe it . for $ 1000 it should be a great lens . my far less expensive 50 f/1.4 beats this lens in clarity and noise at the same settings . unbelievable . i 'm looking into whether i can send it back .
__label__positive__ camera is easy to use but a lot of that power goes to waste when you cant process raw images ... canon 's web site blows when it comes to downloading codec .
__label__positive__ received the flash as described and promptly ! works fine on my nikon d3200 . great price and good quality .
__label__positive__ this is a good deal extra batteries for my video camera the fast charger is a real + lens cleaner is a good thing too . my biggest use for the lense cleaner is bringing the camera from a coolenvireonment to a humid one . lense fogs until it warms up.. not sure about the minitripod .
__label__positive__ works as advertised ; holds battery , looks nice
__label__positive__ delivered on time and very happy with the product .
__label__positive__ nice
__label__negative__ upon mounting this for the first time , it 's permanently stuck onto my canon 50mm , and the locking pin snapped off when attempting to dismount it . taking to camera store tomorrow to repair . stay away from this garbage .
__label__positive__ i am glad it is there for me . i have n't had to use it .
__label__neutral__ i purchased this particular filter for two reasons : it 's cheap , and i wanted something that would allow me some basic experimentation with ir on an unmodified camera . this filter blocks visible light quite well , and it slides on and off my nikon d3300 easily . it gives you the distinctive lovely white vegetation and dark skies. < br / > < br / > however , the quality is low is other areas . when my filter arrived , it had a bubble in the glass , small but distinct ; so far as i can tell , it does not affect the pictures . the bigger problem is that the filter throws off focus . when using one of these filters with an unmodified camera , one has to focus prior to placing the filter on the lens . yet the pictures i take are focused on a point slightly further back than what is clearly in focus prior to screwing on the filter . for landscapes , this has not messed up many shots ; but shooting close-ups with narrow depth of field is a major headache with this filter . finally , this may be a problem with my ( non-ir ) camera rather than the filter , but the dead center of each shot is faded , slightly blurry , and off-color . post-processing can correct the color shift , but not the faded detail. < br / > < br / > but i 've found it fun to play with , and based on these experiments i may invest more fully in ir in the future . in full sunlight , an aperture of f/8 usually requires 25-30 & # 34 ; exposure . i 've attached one picture straight out of the camera , and another with post-processing and exposure stacking .
__label__positive__ does it 's job . holds the hero4 more effectively and without button interference than predecessor .
__label__positive__ gooooooooood
__label__positive__ good article for the price
__label__positive__ work ok for my cctv cams
__label__positive__ good product , it works very well .
__label__positive__ works fine
__label__positive__ i 'm very satisfied with the items , i have n't put the filters to work jet , but the telephoto lens is very good and the wide angle lens is excellent .
__label__positive__ this works great . the remote does n't have to be pointed right at the plug in to turn the light on and off . it makes turning the light on and off super easy .
__label__positive__ great tripod ! thanks .
__label__positive__ satisfied custaomer
__label__positive__ great case for the phantom 3
__label__positive__ my arnart camera fell off my motorcycle helmet onto the roadway and my case got jacked up so needed a new one and this fit perfect ! 👍🏾😁
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ excellent
__label__positive__ i really like it bcause it 's not that big or that small regular size back pack with pockets u can put regular size ipad on the front zipper
__label__negative__ great siren
__label__positive__ links easily with honeywell l7000 .
__label__positive__ this is great . wish i had gotten it before the screen got all scratched up in the first place .
__label__positive__ i had a tripod but it ended up breaking it was cheaply made anyways . so i wanted to buy a new one but i did n't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a tripod for my canon rebel t5 camera . after seeing different tripods and reading reviews i decided to go with this one . i 'm glad i did cause i love it . it is more sturdy and stronger and better length than my old one . i already started using it out and it 's awesome . i definitely recommend this tripod .
__label__positive__ customer support is fabulous . worked on my issue and continued until problem was fixed .
__label__positive__ superfast service and superb quality from this company - this is excellent & # 34 ; no news & # 34 ; news , i 'd say . you will , too .
__label__negative__ not as advertised ! ! do not buy ! ! very cheap looking , whole frame is plastic even screen ! listed as & # 34 ; high resolution digital photo frame 16:9 screen 1280x800 & # 34 ; is actually a 800 x 600 resolution . would not put on my wall ! cheap junk ! does not even have a brand name at all , a genereic plastic item in which the whole thing will flex and twist ! ! !
__label__negative__ i bought this for my wife as an anniversary present to have in her office . i ordered it well ahead of our anniversary so that i would be sure to have it wrapped and ready to give to her as a gift . she had this on the desk in her office for about 2 weeks and then the screen malfunctioned . pictures look washed out as if a contrast or view angle adjustment was needed . while you can adjust brightness , there is no adjustment for contrast or view angle . if i angle the screen upward at 45 degrees , the image looks more normal . i read that other reviews of folks who had similar issues . some people had replacements sent , only to have those fail as well . i have decided not to pursue a repair or replacement and never buy a viewsonic product again . i have bought many times from amazon , but will probably only buy electronics from brick and motor stores from now on due to amazon 's short window for returns on defective products . don & # 34 ; t buy this photo frame !
__label__positive__ it took me over a month from date of purchase to make a review to give it time to observe the system 's functionality and performance . installation was easy if you already knew or planned the location of the cameras and the layout on where to run the cables . dvr and remote viewing set-up were easy and not that complicated , it took me about 30 minutes to set-up the system . i never have to call customer service for help or inquiries , i just read the instructions and watched some youtube videos for additional infos . upon completion of installation and more than a month later , i never had any problems with the system 's performance . videos are clear although not as clear as hd but will do , night vision is also fine . remote viewing is great and working well even when we were in other states , i can check our house and see everything in my cellphone . overall this product is great and highly recommended if you want a security system on a budget .
__label__positive__ awesome service . awesome product****
__label__positive__ is great for a starer kit for studio and practice lighting on subject people or product . all work out accept one light bulb i think it should be easy to replace .
__label__positive__ i love this camera . unlike the other review my minolta hi-matic af2 takes regular aa batteries that are easy to find . it 's a great little point and shoot camera and takes sharp photos .
__label__positive__ this is amazing i got the whole set with no problem i got everything and the camera is great it 's not that loud some of the bad reviews are wrong it must have been a bad shipping or maybe the camera was just messed up in a way but mines perfect i love this camera . ! it took me a while to set up and get the right settings but it takes great pictures ! i recommend ! ! i think most of the bad reviews just had a problem with shipping but everything 's great ☺️the bag has no stains and sorry i could n't get the picture of the tripod about 3/5 of it is useful some of these items do n't work with the camera but most of them do so i think this was a good deal i rather have it around $ 480 for everything be said some of its not useful but the filter lens do n't fit so i just hold them up to the camera and take a picture , over all everything is useful if you find a way !
__label__positive__ i got a lot of fun playing with this toy .
__label__positive__ outstanding , recommend highly , we placed over 400 photos on the frame , and they all look good . wonderful gift idea . i researched many of these devices , and found it difficult to get positive reviews . this unit was about the only one which had excellent reviews . good idea to check the review of all the devices before ordering . we placed 50 years of family pictures on the frame , and the reaction has been extremely positive . i would only suggest a better written and more detailed user guide . this is a 15 inch picture frame , and i would not get anything smaller .
__label__positive__ on our 2nd day flying this helicopter , we did n't realize how windy it was higher up in the sky . a gust caught it and before i could react it was lodged about 60 feet in the top of a tree . there was no hope getting it down . so my son and i began the ritual of checking it daily , hoping it would get blown down and somehow survive the fall . 4 days later the wind picked up again and it dropped about 10 feet . still beyond reach . then after 4 more days a huge storm passed through and it rained for several hours with high winds . we just new it was ruined . after the storm we went out and it had fallen about 30 feet , but we were able to use a ladder and extension pole to knock it down the rest of the way . it crashed down hard so i was almost positive between the wind , rain , and all the falls it would not work . we took it in and opened the battery door and decided to wait 1 week to let it completely dry before trying it . there appeared to be little structural damage . well , a week later we plugged in a charged battery . incredibly , it worked ! what a tough little helicopter ! we are still flying it just very wary of the wind now !
__label__positive__ as on picture . good collection to start with , and maybe it will be enough : ) < br / > < br / > as in other comments , i am not very confident with suction base , but i am yet to test it .
__label__positive__ absolutely love this hand /wrist strap ! < br / > < br / > as a long time user of a cheaper hand strap , i thought i would try this spider strap based on my experience with their holster. < br / > < br / > this is a winner , and worth the money ! works well with my d90 in camera armor with a 18-300mm nikon lens . very comfortable and easy to use .
__label__negative__ these are knockoffs and total junk . avoid this seller .
__label__positive__ my first time using a off camera flash and i love it . the photos look so much better compared to the on camera flash . the trigger control unit works great because it allows me to adjust the exposure and zoom of the flash . it works great with my canon 430exii and my yongnuo yn560 .
__label__positive__ this is easily be the single best monopod i have ever owned !
__label__positive__ love it !
__label__neutral__ good price , but requires additional client software to configure and use the camera - not good for linux users . fortunately , < br / > i have a mac too , and was able to configure the unit to connect to a synoptics nas system for video management .
__label__positive__ i already own one of these frames and did some research before purchasing it . i like this frame , although there was some confusion as to whether it could be used vertically , as you would for portrait images . you can display the frame vertically - either hanging or there is a way to screw in the stand for either vertical and horizontal . however , you will need to rotate the orientation of your photos on your media card/thumb drive clockwise to fill the frame properly .
__label__positive__ took these to a trip to yosemite and was not disappointed . they are very compact and easy to carry around , they would not fit in my pants pocket but fits well in a small compartment in my backpack. < br / > < br / > they are very light and easy to hold for long periods of time . very easy to focus , great for bird watching or concerts .
__label__positive__ good strap
__label__negative__ it 's a very good concept for recording videos from your iphone 6+ but the calibration is nearly impossible . i spent hours trying to calibrate my indiesolo because i did n't wan na give up on it . it took several tries to no avail . it was just too top heavy and i have an iphone 6+ . i do n't have any experience in weight calibration and the video seemed pretty easy to calibrate this thing . i tried it exactly as it was showed on the video and still had no success . it 's too bad because i really liked the idea and the price is pretty affordable compared to the & # 34 ; professional & # 34 ; versions of a stabilizer . if this can be tweaked and maybe make it easier for novice users of a weight calibration unit , then this will sell like candy in a candy store . clearly the potential is there , just not very user friendly . i had to return mine . overall , i do n't recommend this item unless you have better success at calibration than i did .
__label__positive__ great for my cannon t4i
__label__neutral__ this works well with my nikon d80 camera . the only issue i have is that you have to point to it from one side because it will not work if you stand on the opposite end and i find it hard for it to work if i 'm behind the camera too .
__label__positive__ i works perfectly for what i need to do , which is use pro microphones with my nikon d750 and d810 cameras .
__label__positive__ upgraded to this camera after two years with a t3 . first thought -- super fast shutter , way better than t3 . not full frame so i 'll eventually upgrade , but great for what i need now .
__label__positive__ received in time . pleased
__label__positive__ works perfectly ! i 'm new to photography and this worked flawlessly . took some great fireworks shots using this .
__label__positive__ i put one of these everywhere ! i love being able to see : ) < br / > awesome quality !
__label__positive__ i ordered the pink case and it ’ s amazing ! this carrying case has two shades of pink with silver hardware . you can use this case for lots of other things than a fuji camera and film . i like to use my case for my sony camera and accessories . it holds my camera , batteries , cords and more. < br / > < br / > the outside is made with textured pu leather . there is an easy to carry handle . there are two d-rings on the side to use with the included removable shoulder straps . the strap features a sliding buckle so you can adjust the length. < br / > < br / > there are two outside zipper sections . it has a two-way metal zipper one each side with a leather pull . the inside is grey and is super soft . the padded microfiber lining is sure to protect your valuables . there is an accordion type sides to keep the zipper pockets standing and not completely falling open . one zipper section has a zipper pocket inside which is good to hold some smaller item that you don ’ t want to lose. < br / > < br / > the overall size is approximately 7.5 ” w x 6.75 ” h x 4 ” d . this is definitely well made . the case can come in handy to hold a variety of items . i think it would make an adorable play purse for kids . adults can even use it to throw their phone and some makeup in . it ’ s great for traveling . the case has a high-end look and is really spectacular . i received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review .
__label__negative__ okay fit and finish , but the scale starts from the wrong end ! only really useful if the scale starts from the center of the camera , so that numbers are transferable to other setups .
__label__positive__ gets the job done and protects my lenses .
__label__positive__ fits everything you could need , without being heavy or bulky . it 's much smaller than i expected , which is good . zippers are very smooth and do n't catch , which is a pet peeve for me because i dislike zippers that require you to hold one end in order to zip or unzip them .
__label__neutral__ i purchased this to help protect my camera from dings and bumps . it does that but it does n't fit as well as i had hoped it would . hard to use some of the buttons and dials on my camera with the case on it . well made and good quality .. i just did n't care for the fit .
__label__negative__ only gets one star because it ca n't be any lower . i ordered this hoping to use my goprowith it , while attaching it to a slider . if you enjoy ordering a product that comes broken on arrival , the flow-mow is for you . amazon did an excellent job fulfilling the order in less than 24 hours , but there is little to be said about the maker of this product . bolts that hold the gear mechanism together were floating around in the plastic compartment , and the gear assembly was flopping around inside as well . needless to say , it 's not functional .
__label__positive__ extra batteries are must with today 's digital cameras , but often the name brand ones are half as much as the camera itself , so i 've had nothing but great experiences with \\ '' off brand\\ '' batteries i 've purchased from big mike 's electronics ... and the charger works like a charm too , so now i can be rejuicing a battery while shooting away with my extra spares ... only thing stopping me is the size of my memory card ! would happily buy again !
__label__positive__ excellent ! ! it covered my expectation .
__label__positive__ ca n't be beat for the price , this is a professional grade monopod for the videographer on a budget with a very smooth pan & tilt ... great product ! ! !
__label__negative__ returned it
__label__positive__ it 's got a nice heft and i can even see part of its magnesium frame by looking into the battery compartment at an unpainted portion . also reassuring to have the peace of mind that it 's a nikon accessory on a nikon camera body with a nikon usa warranty. < br / > < br / > i 've used an aftermarket grip on my d7100 in the past and have had a great ( albeit short term , ie . less than one year ) experience with a company called & # 34 ; vello & # 34 ; . with that , i chose to purchase another vello grip for my d750 , but this time i experienced issues with the joystick on the grip being unreliable . it was as if the joystick was n't re-centering each time which was a nuisance . if it was consistent , i could have worked around it for the price i paid for it , but it was n't and when it malfunction it was always a surprise at an inopportune time . however , ignoring the possibility that i got a bad sample , the vello did weight a few grams more than the nikon grip . i 'm assuming because of extra plastic used in its construction to make it as durable as the lighter magnesium nikon grip . that 's a good thing in my eyes because i would be a little worried if the plastic vello weighed less than the magnesium nikon. < br / > < br / > the command dials on the vello grip were also much easier to spin , both front and rear dials . the nikon grip has a very tight front dial , especially tough to spin if it 's warm and your finger tips are n't absolutely dry . i 'm hoping the front dial on this nikon grip & # 34 ; breaks in & # 34 ; so to speak , and becomes easier to spin . the rear dial on the nikon grip is a bit easier to spin , but not nearly as easy as the dial on the d750 body itself. < br / > < br / > while both the nikon and vello grips have a full length reinforcing bar for the bottom tripod mount , i do feel better knowing that the nikon has a magnesium frame vs the plastic one on the vello ( which for all i know , could be just as tough , or tougher ) , but i do n't have the resources to test that out. < br / > < br / > i had a completely terribleexperience with a dste grip i purchased here , but i wo n't go into that unless someone really wants to know. < br / > < br / > bottomline : i am not happy with the price nikon is charging for this battery grip , and i would have been perfectly content with the vello grip ( and even strongly suggest it as the best alternative ) had i not received a faulty one , or if i used it only occasionally , however i made the choice to go with nikon because i intend on keeping this grip and the camera body for as long as possible ( i am a hobbyist , not a paid professional ) , and i use the grip almost 95 % of the time so i would rather avoid risks later down the road . i figure i spent $ 2k on the camera body , another $ 2k on a single lens , so what 's another $ 300 for a little bit of insurance and peace of mind ? i understand the fallacy in that argument , especially as a hobbyist , but when it comes to choosing tools , or other things of frequent utility , i believe in & # 34 ; buy once , cry once & # 34 ; . giving it 4 stars because nikon sells it for over $ 100 more on their own website , adding proof that it 's priced to gouge you .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ this lens is better than i thought it would be ! it is very solid and well built . very good quality . who needs a $ 500 gopro now , just a fuji xp70 and this lens for a bit over $ 200 . great purchase , 100 % happy with it ! looks great . makes the video appear better than just a point and shoot camera . good job fuji . take notice canon and nikon !
__label__positive__ delivery on time . was due for new battery , old one about 5 yrs old and was n't holding charge very well
__label__positive__ easy to use , perfect for our needs
__label__negative__ this is not a foscam . it has no manufacture 's name to identify who made the camera . it 's a knockoff of focsam . do n't buy it . it 's in chinese and the language it speaks is in chinese . it takes a micro sd card not a regular sd as the foscam does . this is a fraud . do n't buy it .
__label__positive__ nice and bright
__label__positive__ purchased this pristine camera with battery grip , magnifier eyepiece , sigma flash . well-pleased with everything i have used so far ; have not used flash . shutter count was low 1500 . seller answered all my questions to my satisfaction and i recommend this seller .
__label__positive__ unit does what it was designed to do and i like it a lot . was a bit disappointing with how weak the edge support is , but overall works fine .
__label__positive__ this is a phenomenal tripod.easy to use , lightweight and easy to carry for travel . this tripod fits crosswise inside the bottom of my medium size messenger bag . it also has a hook attacked to the certer column to hang on the outside of your bag as well . it is so light you would hardly notice that it is there . this tripod is loaded with features , and it was quite inexpensive . when i received the tripod i was surprised ( and a bit worried ) at just how small it really is ! i found the unit to work well . the independently adjustable leg angles worked good for uneven terrain . i would recommend this to anyone looking for a compact tripod
__label__positive__ this lens puts the canon 50mm f18 ii to shame . the focus is quieter and faster plus the sharpness of this lens is excellent . i am a professional photographer that prefers my l lenses , but this lens is amazingly sharp wide open . i tend to shoot with my 70-200mm l lens the majority of the time for most portraits , but this lens will definitely be brought out on many occasions . if you have the 50mm f1.8 ! ! , it is definitely time to upgrade . there is so much difference between the quality of this lens in both build and sharpness . the fact that they upgraded and kept this lens the same price is amazing . i definitely recommend this lens whether this is your first prime , or you are wanting to upgrade from canon 's nifty fifty that was produced before this . the sharpness wide open at f1.8 is excellent even in low light . you will not be disappointed . throw your canon 50mm f1.8 ii away and get this lens . i highly recommend it ! this lens trumps the 50mm f1.4 lens also .
__label__positive__ was able to use my canon lens with no problem . creates product ever invented . safe me money from buying extra lens .
__label__positive__ i am writing because of the negative reviews of this lens which i 'm not getting . i have been shooting a long time and have degrees both undergraduate and graduate in photography . i have been shooting from back in the day with view camera 's , processing my own film and doing my own prints until the digital age . i have been shooting this lens on a nikon d800 and i find this lens as sharp as some other very expensive nikon lenses worth thousands of dollars . of course , wide open , it has a very short field in focus but what is in focus is pin sharp . this lens is not a beginners lens , it is a very good lens and at the price , is not even an investment , it is a flat out gift .
__label__positive__ for the clarity and brightness i can not see how they can be beaten at the sub- $ 500 price . period .
__label__positive__ nice
__label__neutral__ it needs to be charged too much .
__label__positive__ these ultra-gentle cloths left no scratches , streaks or marks on any of the items i 've used them on which included : < br / > rx eyeglasses < br / > rx sunglasses < br / > iphone screen < br / > mac screen < br / > macbook pro screen < br / > kindle screen < br / > canon camera lens < br / > sony bravia 52 & # 34 ; lcd hdtv < br / > < br / > these cloths all come individually wrapped . they are made of extremely fine microfibers and are safe for all delicate surfaces . i simply hand wash mine in warm water only with no detergent and air dry them . the packaging says they are also safe for gps devices , binocular lenses < br / > and all multicoated lenses. < br / > < br / > the reviews are overwhelmingly positive ( currently 4421 five stars to only 41 one star ) . those people who were dissatisfied should note that the packaging says & # 34 ; if this is not the best microfiber cloth you have ever used , we 'll take it back at our expense without questions or hassles. & # 34 ; i do n't understand why anyone dissatisfied does n't take advantage of the digitalgoja 90-day 100 % < br / > satisfaction guarantee. < br / > < br / > i have noticed that sometimes little specks are stuck to a digital screen , but when i dampen the magicfiber cloth , the screen comes perfectly clean ! the same thing works on my glasses if anything is stuck on them . you need to hand wash the cloths with warm water only and let them dry so you do n't scratch something with the dust and particulates the cloth has picked up. < br / > < br / > i 'm ready to purchase the larger cloths for cleaning the large screens now that i see how well these cloths work !
__label__negative__ hard to install . i returned it . you have to be somewhat technical for one of these or you 're gon na struggle .
__label__positive__ everything you need for a quick fix , including a bike mount . awesome !
__label__positive__ works perfect
__label__positive__ it is a very strong flash , better than the nikon i used to have . the i-ttl works right . the unit works with both my old d70 and my much newer coolpix p7700 . it does everything it is supposed to do and the price was a fraction of what i have paid for speedlights in the past . also , it arrived promptly and was properly packed ,
__label__positive__ great product , never have to worry about losing caps again !
__label__neutral__ this sample sent for review is one i 'm comparing against a similarly priced kit from baxia . for my usage , these kits are used on two fauxpro ( gopro clones ) cams . more or less , the parts are nearly identical , good quality stuff . both work just fine the my two cams and all their original accessories . what does get me though is the price . for a couple of bucks more , the baxia kit offers 2-3 times the accessories , kinda making it a no brainer on which one to buy .
__label__positive__ amazing product . reasonable price .
__label__positive__ perfect match for my canon 20da without the extra cost of canon branded batteries and charger . i 'm pleased with this purchase .
__label__positive__ they work fine . very happy with them
__label__positive__ love my contour , its been through a tough mudder on the first use , still works and looks great , waiting for snowboarding season
__label__positive__ i was given a coupon code to test this item and review it . all opinions are my own and are based solely on my personal observations at the time of testing. < br / > < br / > i wanted to note several things that were noticed right away when this accessory kit arrived that have caused me to delete stars . ***i see that the packing list is now in the item description . i have modified my review and moved to 4 stars to reflect this . *** < br / > < br / > 1 ) the case is vastly different than what is pictured . the case sent to me has an open bottom with a strip of foam that encases the sides and edges . ( the right side of the picture looks like what the bottom of this case looks like. < br / > < br / > 2 ) the case is packed tightly . all of the accessories are haphazardly packed inside . upon unzipping the case , several accessories , including a tiny baggie with a sim card fell out. < br / > < br / > 3 ) no instructions are included for anything , it is a case with a stack of parts/accessories in little plastic baggies with a few loose parts not in baggies . most of it is self-explanatory , but it would be nice to have had at least a guideline . ( now there is a packing list in the description , print this out , you will need it to determine what everything is ! ) < br / > < br / > the items seem to good quality , that is the only thing keeping this set from getting three stars instead of four . i am happy with the quality , the case is a excellent quality , despite not looking like the picture here . if i had paid full price for this item , i would still be giving it a four star vote for lack of the above items. < br / > < br / > the case is enclosed in a little cloth bag . the bag is pretty and meant to make the item seem as if it is worth more . the bag is not needed and will be in the way of using the case as the bag must be removed before opening the case . i will not be using the bag around the case. < br / > < br / > my vote is that the seller stop including an expensive bag and include a packing list and some rudimentary directions for item use and a packing list inside the case instead .
__label__positive__ works great . for a replacement and a must have extra juice , this item is one of the item that should accompany your camera all time . recommended ! !
__label__positive__ these batteries seem to do well . i 'd buy them again . am pleased with this product .
__label__positive__ i use this for my pentax wg-3 16mp waterproof camera . it 's a snug fit , but there is room . the pocket has room for a spare battery and a drive to transfer photos and the zippered pocket holds a spare memory card and cleaning cloth . for my needs it 's a perfect fit though it might be a bit small if you want to stow anything more than i 've mentioned . i love the lowpro cases though - they 've held up well and work beautifully .
__label__positive__ great lens for the money buy now before the price increases .
__label__negative__ this cage does not fit the a7rii . the battery door does not line up and the top dial is severely blocked . good build quality however , just wish it fit like it claimed to .
__label__positive__ very good product for the price . i would buy it again
__label__negative__ stick paper on back is terrible . unit falls off ! i ordered two of these and what a mistake that was . also not that sensitive . i would not but this again .
__label__positive__ i am very glad that i purchased this camera and it is everything i hoped it would be and more . the zoom is very good and the image stabilization has left me astonished at the clear pictures i am able to take . i was amazed that i was able to take clear pictures of a hawk in a tree , at max zoom , while i was on a kayak and was not able to stabilize my elbows on anything. < br / > < br / > i am new to photography , cellphone cameras were n't able to take the shots i wanted , and i did n't want to jump into dslr 's without getting my feet wet with a point and shoot first . with 50x optical zoom i am able to take clear pictures of small objects from far away and the image stabilization is amazing even at max zoom . the wifi option is very convenient . i have used the remote shooting feature using my cellphone though the most common use i have for the wifi is transferring pictures off the camera . you can connect the camera to a house wifi or , better yet , the camera will become it 's own access point letting you access the camera with your cell without being near a router . the camera comes with preset shooting modes for common situations that people encounter as well as letting you manually customize the settings as well . as i explore the shooting modes and play with changing setting manually i feel that i can get a lite version of the dslr experience without having to take the monetary plunge . i am excited to explore more of the camera 's settings , both manual and preset , as i come up with new shots i want to take . with this camera i can see why people enjoy photography so much .
__label__positive__ i like it ! it is like insurance protection on your camera and it allows a good grip to avoid dropping the camera ... but protects from damage if dropped . all buttons are protected and usable , and labeled for use without taking the cover off .
__label__positive__ as described ... work well
__label__positive__ satisfied
__label__positive__ fits perfectly on my manfrotto 501 tipod head . almost identical to the original quick-release plate .
__label__positive__ each added bellow significantly reduces the focal point. < br / > i have cataracts and spent 2 or more hours and hundreds of < br / > frames to get just one reasonable shot , and that 's without one of the bellows. < br / > light is very important and the flash on my 7d did n't give enough light , so i < br / > taped a small flashlight to the top of my 7d and angled it down which did the trick. < br / > even the 1 good shot has my cornea in focus and my retina out of focus . thats how < br / > critical the focus is , using this . it was worth the money just to do the experiments ...
__label__positive__ just as shown
__label__neutral__ i have n't used the product yet , just came in the mail today . i was surprised by how crushed up it was . it was mailed in a very soft package with the film and literature pretty jammed in . there is a piece of tissue paper , a piece of thin foil material , and a piece of white plastic film which i assume is the product , they all came folded up in the accompanying literature . since i have never used this material before , a little help would have been nice . however , all the literature they sent with it is in german .
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ bought this for my son and he loves it . very easy to use !
__label__positive__ the rip cord is somewhat hard to pull on . i bought this cause i wanted something waterproof for my morning walks in case it rains but i 'm not a fan of the design . i wish it had a lanyard so i could keep it around my neck . or a wristband . something ... .
__label__neutral__ the strap is well made however the hook could be better made . it is flimsy and feels like it could easily break . i will replace it before using it on my camera .
__label__positive__ loved it !
__label__negative__ these things do not work , save your money and buy the chamberlain one its way better
__label__positive__ decent picture . easy installation .
__label__neutral__ love this lens . first copy had front element fall out of it , as it was only secured by glue . had to buy a second copy , but image quality and usability is great .
__label__positive__ great
__label__neutral__ i was expecting this bag to be smaller . from the photo it looks like i can fit the fuji polaroid 210 perfectly in there . i can fir the camera in there and a small village. < br / > good quality though , shipped quick so kudos .
__label__neutral__ it worked great the 3 times i used it . i 'm assuming it just needs a new battery but was expecting the battery to last a little longer . pretty inconvenient when i went out for shoot and was expecting to use it . luckily i had the pentax backup remote .
__label__negative__ the nikon p900 is a wide angle len . this has a large crop factor . just did not work for me . you may have better results
__label__positive__ i like this a lot but i 'm not a huge fan of how you strap the tripod on .
__label__neutral__ overall product works like it should however after about two uses the screw to clamp the camera mount to the head strap stripped out . i stole a screw and nut from another go pro mount and replaced it and has worked fine since .
__label__positive__ exactly what i need for pictures
__label__positive__ i own this camera along with the sony rx100 ii and the older canon g1 x. i travel a fair amount and like to keep a small , big sensor camera in my carrybag . the sony and g1 x took dozens of trips in my carrbag & # 34 ; as is & # 34 ; . i bought this camera because i wanted the f2.8 speed at the long end of the lens range compared to either of the other two cameras . i find the g7x a better picture taker than the sony when you need to use the long end of the range in low light . the newer sonys ( iii , iv ) gave up the & # 34 ; 100 mm & # 34 ; equivalent focal length btw , so these new cameras do n't do what i want. < br / > unfortunately the trim ring and blades that cover the g7x lens when & # 34 ; off & # 34 ; are protection in name only . the sony r100 ii bounced around in my suitcase or carrybag dozens of times with no problems -- no case , no protection . some people may assume cameras are fragile and always put them in a little case . this was never my experience until i bought this camera . a trip in my carrybag dented the trim ring and blades , which are a soft and thin metal with no structure underneath . the camera was unusable . would n't open or close properly . 45 minutes of work with a metal pick & # 34 ; fixed & # 34 ; the issue . but many people would not want to attempt this type of repair and would be facing a big repair bill or loss on the camera . so sadly , this camera is less convenient than i presumed.put it in a hard case before you put it in a bag .
__label__positive__ i like this camera , it was great getting started a few years ago . it helped me start a photography business . however , i would only suggest this if you 're a beginner or on a budget . i 've only been using the kit lens , so maybe that 's why it was n't outstanding for me , i do n't know . the images attached are a f5.0 and iso 1600 on the kit lens .
__label__positive__ so comfortable in your mouth and can be used in all sports and activities . super easy to breathe also
__label__positive__ these are original props and fit perfectly !
__label__positive__ love this thing ! ! super easy to use and takes great videos .
__label__positive__ needed a second charger to charge two of my camera batteries at a time . this works great and easy to use . very happy with product .
__label__negative__ says wireless but wo n't connect to it .
__label__positive__ everything worked perfectly . very satisfied. < br / > < br / > e
__label__positive__ i love this extension pole . purchased it for a vacation in the caribbean . the material looks of very good quality . worked well in the sea and pool water . even on a high speed boat the pole was very sturdy . it 's easy to put on the mount for the gopro . very durable and when extending it was very smooth . there was no struggle when adjusting it to a certain length . ca n't wait to try it out this winter while snowboarding ! ! i highly recommend this product !
__label__positive__ is the best compromise in terms of lens . i used on vacation and i was happy with the result . i both it used and it was just perfect as new .
__label__neutral__ the charger needs instructions . it does not look like the correct charger for the battery . it actually does work , but i had to complain to the company before getting an explanation as to how to place the battery . the space for the battery is too large , and the contacts do n't match . the trick is that all of the contacts are not needed for charging , so if you put the battery in so that two of the contacts are touching , it charges just fine .
__label__negative__ this product didnt work , its bad quality ! no good at all
__label__positive__ have used this on all my cameras . simple , but it works
__label__positive__ this is a great backpack for anyone that has a lot of camera gear they want to take with them . the inside is fully customizable which is great and it is very easy to get your gear out quick when you need to take a photo . the laptop pocket is great and has more than enough room for my 15 & # 34 ; macbook pro . i do however wish there was a small divider so you could easily put a notebook to write on or something like that . the backpack is made form high quality material and the included rain cover is a great touch. < br / > < br / > this easily fits my two nikons with lenses on and an addition 2 or 3 lenses with room to spare .
__label__positive__ actually purchased this unit new after using a used ( 4 yo ) unit . it really works great as we have used it for second camera work on our show . it is great for a fixed angle camera and the audio we generally add in during editing though we have attached it to a wireless mike that did just fine . our unit was cheaper than a gopro but the 1080p clarity is just as good and the lens gives us a straight on picture instead of the wide angle look of the go pro . so far , have been able to get extra batteries and using extended sd cards works great . best part is the ability to see what is being filmed though the screen is small . also having a hdmi port is a neat feature . too bad kodak dropped it .
__label__positive__ love this camera . i 'm still trying to figure out the basics of photography . once i get those down pat , i 'm going to really love it !
__label__positive__ fluid head : i 'll give it a b-
__label__positive__ does it job nicely , and folds well into its little pouch . fits my yongnuo yn560 flash .
__label__positive__ the security guys asked for $ 600 , well i bought these and installed them on existing wires as i had replaced my windows . work like a charm , tested with security company all reeds work 100 %
__label__positive__ i am soooo happy to get this and it works wonders , thank you !
__label__positive__ super great bag , solid and well padded . it does come with a shoulder strap . compartments for other accessories as well .
__label__positive__ i work in the concrete field . i drop my iphone 6 in full case inthis bag for extra protection . i purchased a lifeproof case the last time and it protected the phone flawlessly . but the concrete dust , dirt dust and sweaty 40 hours outside conditions . after 6 months i could n't read the screen in sunlight it was so filthy and faded . windexed daily but it did n't help . several guys at work use these bags so i am going to try my luck . jon m little elm , texas
__label__positive__ everything works great
__label__negative__ the filter has a very high quality feel to it , but the images produced by this filter are sub-par . at the maximum darkness used for long exposure , the filter produces a bluish tint that washes out the photos . i am not sure if this problem is because of my filter specifically , but for the money you are spending , you should have better photo quality . i bought a cheaper $ 20 variable nd filter and it produced better color balanced photos . very disappointed
__label__negative__ i wanted to like this but it has multiple problems . for one it is a bit heavy on the flash head so it tends to droop ( both the diffuser itself and the flash head ) . there 's nothing metal or rigid at the front of the diffuser to keep it open properly or round so you end up having to adjust it and pray it stays . this product just is n't worth the hassle .
__label__positive__ my only gripe is that the tripod itself does not come with even one of these plates . had i known this up front i probably would have looked at other models since it rendered the tripod useless until i had these plates .
__label__positive__ this lens is interesting . the f8.0 means you 'll need a decent amount of lighting to get a good shot , but it 's possible to do without to much trouble . it 's a bit pricey for what it is though , and the focus slider is a bit touchy . buy if you want something to use instead of a lens cap , and to take some pinhole style shots , otherwise skip it .
__label__positive__ good tripod
__label__neutral__ pros : -compact and lightweight -telescoping legs cons : -feels a bit flimsy -does n't extend high enough overall , the tripod does the job so long as you do n't ask too much out of it . it 's lightweight and feels somewhat flimsy . decent basic , intro level tripod . if your a pro , go for something else . the price is n't bad which is why i decided to go with this particular tripod . but , you get what you pay for . update : spn performance got in contact with me to try and satisfy some of my complaints . top notch customer service . i appreciate their dedication and commitment to customer satisfaction . great company going above and beyond .
__label__positive__ the charger works great . i bought this to replace the charger that came with my light and it works flawlessly .
__label__positive__ worked great . nothings perfect , but it works . the stem that goes into battery insert in the camera , seems a little fragile . handle with care . overall , good product . glad i purchased it , lasted a lot longer since i use my 70d for video .
__label__negative__ this battery does not hold a charge at all . it lasted for only about four shots . i also believe it created error 70 in my canon 6d , which was an error with the images , and requires one to re-install the battery . this continued to happen until i got a new battery .
__label__positive__ absolutely stunning ! < br / > the view is breathtaking and crystal clear across the entire field of view. < br / > on top of that this thing is bigger than a baseball ! ! !
__label__neutral__ this comes with two back attachments for the waterproof housing . i did n't realize that the two differen back peices were for two different size cases , so i stuck the floatie onto one at random . it turns out that i stuck it to the wrong one , so i could n't get it on the waterproof casing for my hero3-white , and now it is totally useless . hopefully i will be able to get it off with a hair drier . otherwise i just wated my money . they shuld really label them or something .
__label__positive__ it is crucial that you read the instructions . the picture needs to go face down in a dark place ( a shut hand bag , drawer , whatever ) and be left alone for at least thirty minutes ... i 'd wait forty minutes . do n't bend or squeeze any part of the picture . i used to do this to hurry the process with the old instant film , but doing it to this film will ruin the picture . after the forty minute wait , and after looking at the photo , if it 's a keeper , store it overnight in the dark in a standing position while it & # 34 ; cures. & # 34 ; this is n't polaroid film , and it is n't & # 34 ; instant. & # 34 ; if you treat this like we all used to treat the old polaroid pictures when they popped out , especially out in sunlight , and do n't quickly get it face down in a dark place , without putting your fingers on the picture area , and without giving the thick part of the border a squeeze , the picture will be ruined . in my experience with it , even under the best circumstances , it does n't compete with the contrast and focus of the old polaroid film , but i use it for something that benefits from the more gauzy impressionistic look . it 's too expensive for eight pictures that may or may not be any good . if you want anything that looks like an old polaroid picture and use this film , again , read the instructions . i curse polaroid for discontinuing their instant film . that said , if you have money to burn ( i do n't ) and want to experiment with it , and like the more ghostly look of the pictures , it is fun stuff , and it 's nice to be able to use the old camera again . flash and everything still worked . the camera is fed by the battery in the film cartridge , just as it was by the polaroid film cartridges . you get eight pictures from this , not ten . at around $ 3 per picture , it 's worth your time to read the instructions carefully and follow them , if you want anything that looks like a decent regular picture . some of this film has a black border , some the standard white , and i have n't figured out which is which onamazon . if anyone knows , please leave the product number for the black frame in a comment . thanks .
__label__positive__ i received a canon tc , when i really needed a nikon , but i did n't want to give it a bad review just because i got the wrong item . based on my experience with the kenko for nikon , i think this would be perfect for using with the appropriate canon lens .
__label__negative__ these seemed ok at first , but both rapidly decreased in their ability to hold a charge . within four months , one was completely dead and the other showed 12 minutes after a charge . other batteries charged normally in the same charger . since they advertise a i year warranty , i have asked for replacements or a refund ( preferably ) , but after 2 weeks i have n't gotten a response .
__label__positive__ good package deal ! the camera is very good and have been getting great results so far .
__label__positive__ thank you !
__label__positive__ while the add is listed as 1 piece , you get 2 one for the top of the camera and one for the back . applying the glass was easy and went on with no bubbles at all . you do n't even know its on the screen . i would purchase this item again .
__label__positive__ a+
__label__positive__ this is not a complicated item . it works as it should . no complaints .
__label__positive__ it 's great i bought this for mountain biking and it has held up through many bumps and some crashes and records great and stays tight .
__label__positive__ great camera , great seller .
__label__negative__ camera was used had over 1000 clicks on the shutter and something was wrong with the video .
__label__positive__ works exactly as expected . christmas morning pictures last year turned out awesome !
__label__positive__ great bino 's , able to see craters on the moon for the first time . i will be jumping into a telescope before too long .
__label__positive__ camera is good . setup instructions are not clear . but you will figure out after trying few times . i like phone view and send pics by email . i am not using upload to cloud feature
__label__positive__ works great . very happy with it . i love the zoom function
__label__positive__ work perfectly , but if you have a high speed sync flash from canon ( or at least a 430 ex ii ) , you will not be able to use high speed sync even if you set it manually . this is a cannon issue , however , there are cheap ttl triggers that allow hss to work . that being said , these work also really well as a wireless shutter release .
__label__positive__ i love this camera . great macro . high quality photos . perfect size . get a warranty tho , the lens gives out after about a year or 2
__label__positive__ love the color and how small it is . i can fit it into a smaller purse without loosing it
__label__negative__ not to work never got chance try until to late to send back
__label__neutral__ it works , but it 's just a little irritating putting on and taking off . you have to twirl it around a bit for it to catch the grooves .
__label__positive__ this is a great camera . could make due with a few advanced features , but i love it anyway : )
__label__positive__ great item
__label__neutral__ it works but is pretty rinky dink . i would n't put a really expensive flash on this .
__label__positive__ philips wireless home monitor is perfect ... it is small in fact tiny and can be put in a inconspicuous area . i love it and it does the trick ... < br / > i can see who is in my home and see if someone is up to & # 34 ; no-good & # 34 ; < br / > money spent well !
__label__positive__ great cameras and used daily !
__label__positive__ nice camera with a lot of features .
__label__positive__ great bargain .
__label__positive__ came really fast. < br / > had no defects < br / > im in love with this product : )
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ wored great
__label__negative__ heavy metal . poor quality . dings in threads .
__label__negative__ junk , believe me ... ... ..just saying
__label__positive__ still being exposed ...
__label__positive__ i was very upset when i left my extra camera battery and charger behind on vacation . i thought getting replacements would be expensive . i found this on amazon for a great price . it works just fine and you ca n't beat this price !
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ great buy for a starter kit . nothing has broken so far and i have taken these accessories multiple trips
__label__positive__ great camera !
__label__positive__ it does have a bit of a short range and you do have to finesse it a little bit when you pointed at the camera but otherwise it works fairly well for me . it does have limitations but i 'm not expecting much . i think it does do what it 's supposed to do , too many people are expecting the world from it and it 's a infrared device much like a tv remote and again those do have a lot of limitations as well so work with it have fun with it but do n't expect to get a group shot of 100 people from a hundred feet away ...
__label__negative__ it did what it was supposed to do . sadly it came off very easily . eventually it was lost and never seen again .
__label__positive__ what can i say . if you do n't have this , you should . buy it . highly recommend it .
__label__positive__ as expected and loving it ! due to the padding you may run out of room if your using it as a camera/laptop bag .
__label__negative__ received this yesterday and the gopro mount/clamp did not work ( would not open/close properly w/use of adjustment knob ) . did not include instructions . also had a thick/crusted adhesive ( ? ) on the mounting screw , which probably causes the aforementioned problem . will be returning this item . might be better off with genuine gopro products .
__label__positive__ just what i need and price was great . shipped fast .
__label__positive__ disclaimer : this is my first camera with an interchangeable lens , so you might read this review with that in mind. < br / > < br / > i did a whole lot of research trying to pick the right camera for my needs . i 'm just getting into astrophotography and wanted something i could shoot some nice widefield shots with but occasionally be able to connect to my 8 & # 34 ; dobsonian telescope in prime focus . i was initially less than enthusiastic about getting a mirrorless camera -- i liked the idea of a real viewfinder and a more traditional method of manual focusing . but , my requirement that it connect to my telescope in prime focus edged me over to the mirrorless camp . the flange focal distance on these things is tiny ; combined with a low profile t-ring , you get your sensor in a great deal closer. < br / > < br / > even after i decided on a mirrorless , i was looking at several models that had some wonderful features and were rated quite a bit more highly by professional reviewers . eventually , i could n't justify the price difference . i got this at a steal : $ 245.00 ( it was actually $ 299 , but the price dropped to $ 245 the next day , so a quick email to amazon rectified that , but i digress . ) one thing i noted was that reviewers were pretty hard on the pixel density of the evf and the lcd . since the lack of a real viewfinder was one of my turnoffs for mirrorless cameras in the first place , this bothered me . another concern i had was the lack of manual controls on it . ( the only dial on the top is the pasm mode selector . ) reviewers also mentioned the lightweight , plastic , cheap feel of it . again -- these reviewers are probably not comparing it to anything that sells for quite this low. < br / > < br / > after receiving it , i was pleasantly surprised in almost every aspect . only being able to compare this with point-and-shoot cameras i 've used in the past , i thought the lcd and evf have plenty of definition . i also think the color on the lcd is nice -- some details in star fields almost showed up more clearly on the lcd than they did later on my 1080p ips display . though , i 'll admit the evf is n't as usable as i 'd hoped it would be. < br / > < br / > as far as controls , it 's not bad . with the included 18-55mm lens , zoom is manual , turning the ring just like you 'd expect . manual focus is a & # 34 ; drive-by-wire & # 34 ; system -- there 's a focus ring on the lens that rotates infinitely in either direction , acting as an encoder to control the powered focus , and it works quite nicely . the dial on the back of the camera can quickly be switched from shutter speed to aperture setting . with the limited customization available , it 's not hard to get at iso by pressing the right side of the dial to pull up that function. < br / > < br / > in conclusion ... if you 're considering this for your first dslr/mlc , i do n't think you 'll be disappointed , and you 'll probably have to pay a lot more to get much improvement. < br / > < br / > i 'll try to add some astrophotography images when i learn what i 'm doing .
__label__negative__ i purchased these thinking the monarch line would be great , and these are camo , great for hunting . however i could not get the right side to focus at all . i tried the focus adjustment at the eyepiece , and the main focus adjustment . they would not focus and i could not get the same picture in both eyes . also the picture seemed a little cloudy . thinking i received a bad pair i went to gander mountain to have a look . their floor model there was exactly the same . trouble focusing the right eye and a cloudy picture . the monarch 5 and 7 were great . crystal clear picture and great focus , however way over my budget . the nikon prostaff 7 had a picture as good as if not better than the monarch line and they were less expensive . for only $ 200 i got a much better pair of binoculars that are crystal clear . too bad they do not come in camo colored. < br / > < br / > i reccomend the nikon prostaff 7 over the nikon monarch series of binoculars . same great picture , much easier on the wallet .
__label__positive__ perfect !
__label__negative__ could use a revision on the app . seriously thinking about returning it just because of the poor software . the camera is grainy compared to my arlos . it 's easy to set up i wish you did n't have to drill such a big hole in the wall for the bulky ethernet plug though. < br / > < br / > updated : < br / > after about a month trying to deal with it i asked to return it . for some reason you ca n't view old videos , which basically makes it useless unless you 're only using it to view a live feed .
__label__neutral__ this was okay but i was n't happy with some of functionality . so i returned it . i wanted something a little bit more high-end . however for the price it will do the job .
__label__positive__ this flash is wonderful with a nikon d7100 . i am not a pro so it does n't get beat up too much . commander mode and ttl work great .
__label__positive__ i am new to the slr cameras with a cannon dslr i received as a reward . i was able to use a couple of older lenses i got for a song . i am now able to expand my photography abilities beyond the limitations of the lens that came with the camera . i have been able to use a tamron 70-210 lens that i gotten . i have been able to take great shots and am really enjoying photography .
__label__neutral__ too snug . hard to get on flash unit .
__label__positive__ perfect size for my needs . fits my nikon d750 with 24-120mm lens , 50mm lens , and accessories snugly with room left over for a flash if needed . all this fits in the lower compartment while still leaving the upper compartment free. < br / > < br / > when worn the backpack looks and feels compact and not bulky .
__label__neutral__ used on a wide angle lens ( 24mm ) i got vignetting with this circular polarizer . worse vignetting when stacked on a uv filter . the tech person at tiffen suggested that the right choice for that lens was this one instead http : //www.amazon.com/tiffen-77widcp-circular-polarizer-filter/dp/b000084fdg/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=utf8 & qid=1441053166 & sr=8-1 & keywords=77widcp . big difference in price . perhaps i missed the disclaimer about wide angle lenses .
__label__positive__ just as described
__label__positive__ great mount just like any other gopro mount . fits perfectly and allows access to the cable ports and all .
__label__positive__ works well , seems to be pretty steady and sturdy .
__label__positive__ works as expected and does its job of conveniently configuring camera/video peripherals . money well spent .
__label__positive__ bought this one as a gift . i bought a couple of 82mm for my canon 24mm-70mm . and they work perfectly .
__label__positive__ great value for the money .
__label__positive__ great product & value - thanks !
__label__negative__ junk its over heat while using 2 battery pack , i swap the batteries twice hand it still overheated outdoor , i have an outdoor event coming up in october '15 and i know now i cant use them the yn560iii did n't give any problems , while using the same set of battries the mago speedlight had in them.all other feature were ok
__label__positive__ excellent . works great for my camera !
__label__positive__ great inexpensive alternative .
__label__negative__ easy to install . i had one camera stop working after 6 months .
__label__positive__ scope can go very far
__label__negative__ material is definately waterproof . access to camera through sleeves is good and camera controls are easily visible . however , lens section is very stiff and works best with long lenses , but resists collapsing for shorter lenses . by the time everything is cinched up , it is difficult to locate and rotate the telephoto ring . i 'm also puzzled how you cinch up the sleeves after your hands are inserted ?
__label__positive__ works great with my lee foundation kit and lee hood .
__label__positive__ if you want to have a camera right out in the open and not have anyone know you are recording , this little guy has got you covered . i do n't like little stuff because i do n't have tiny hands , but the mecum is still easy for me to operate . happy i bought it .
__label__positive__ as advertised
__label__positive__ bought this for use in studio -- but now carry it with me when i 'm shooting outdoors real estate photos . keeps glare off lens . highly recommend it .
__label__positive__ fast delivery and good product . easy to handle and very light . i love this !
__label__positive__ works as expected < br / > delivered on time
__label__negative__ cord holding cap immediately fell off ... not reordering . there has to be something better !
__label__positive__ i ` ve been quite happy with this camera , nice ir capability , great quality for the price . i had issues with reception because i mounted it a long way from my wifi hub , but i added a mediabridge repeater and that cured my issues. < br / > easy setup , app works pretty well . the only issue is that google chrome is discontinuing support for the method used to interface this camera , which is annoying . i don ` t really consider that a fault of ctronics though .
__label__negative__ updating the review . this battery died in the middle of a photoshoot & was a huge embarrassment . the battery was fully charged when it died on me . neither of my 6d 's power on with this battery any more . not buying this cheap stuff any more .
__label__positive__ i love this bag ! holds most of my equipment , is sturdy enough to stand on its own , and has a nice compartment for my laptop/tablet . i have been using it quite a bit and it seems to be holding up pretty well .
__label__positive__ so far , so good . just got them- came to me before expected . will see how they end up performing
__label__positive__ easy to set up and use via phone apps . can not zoom in browser app . 2-way audio and night vision work well . hd feed is nice .
__label__positive__ they did a good job , film is of good quality . i would recommend this company to friends .
__label__positive__ my husband was happy !
__label__positive__ great deal for backup and replacement batteries .
__label__positive__ cute and works as described .
__label__positive__ very nice tripod . i like the sturdy feel of it .
__label__positive__ tastes great ! ! !
__label__negative__ i began to display a month after purchasing the product freezing . wifi is very slow work . after 2 months , the water present , not working at all .
__label__positive__ i do n't know what a go pro camera is other than it 's a camera , i do however love the case . it 's a cloth fabric case , but it has stiffeners inside the fabric that can not be seen outside or inside the case . not a hard shell , but certainly not a soft shell . a hard shell with a little give to it . i 've got mine to put all of my tuning equipment and picks for my baritone dulcimer and it will perfectly fit into the top portion of its soft case . always before i 'd have the tuner floating around the large instrument case , but now i have the added protection of this case and the padding as well . foam originally was for a go pro camera set up , but i simply took a razor blade knife and cut the edge on the inside leaving a 1/4 & # 34 ; layer of foam all around the edge of the case . all the padding necessary for the gear i 'll be putting into it . definitely worth the money . kevin .
__label__positive__ i bought this fortress system , and it works great i can arm this system anywhere by either with a phone call or text . with home armed the motion sensors would not be tripped . but in the out mode , every thing is armed . i love it ... ... great
__label__neutral__ it 's a good kit for a great price . the pieces are not as well polished as the gopro-branded ones but they 'll do the job . the snap-on locks are a little stiff so i have to squeeze with both thumbs to unlock. < br / > < br / > my only complaint so far is the & # 34 ; spideer floaty backdoor & # 34 ; . the picture and description makes it look like the kit includes a spideer branded foam float attached to an included backdoor . i am not familiar with the spideer brand but what i received was just an orange foam without a brand on it. < br / > < br / > i contacted the seller to inquire about this discrepancy and i will update
__label__negative__ was n't what i needed
__label__positive__ worked as advertised . full charge within a short time ... replaced original .
__label__positive__ great for indoor and on the go !
__label__positive__ works well !
__label__positive__ i always resisted spending out the extra cash on these red ringed beauties from canon thinking & # 34 ; well really how much better can it really be , is it really worth the extra cash ! ! & # 34 ; .. i decided to get one after a long time and as these lenses will not break your bank to much i went ahead and got it . wow , what a lens , the reproduction of colour is amazing and the sharpness compared to kit lenses is just like chalk and cheese . ok its not the fastest of lenses in poor light , i would n't say it was even the best of red ringed lenses , but you will not be disappointed , i did a model shoot using it for the first time , ( im not a professional by any stretch of the imagination ) in ok ambient if rather dull light and with the aid of the is the shoot went well and had no issues of blur or noise at 500 iso on a canon 7d , itself not being the greatest of cameras controlling noise , here is a link to some pictures with very very little done post processing except minor adjustment of exposure etc . bear in mind as i said i am not a professional photographer and this was only my second model shoot , and my flash run out of battery lol ... https : //www.facebook.com/photo.php ? fbid=10206874022786264 & set=a.10206874017026120.1073741875.1147937400 & type=1 & theater
__label__positive__ great diffuser . its basically a gary fong imitation at a much cheaper price .
__label__positive__ the film takes great pics . i would n't & # 34 ; shake it like a polaroid picture & # 34 ; because i did , to make the picture develop faster , and it left the film with weird crackle looking marks . i gave it 4 stars because i consider the price expensive , but i guess that 's the going rate for film .
__label__positive__ this works just as good as the metabones adaptors , but at a fraction of the cost . that makes them an unbelievable value and an essential part of your kit . i 've got this one and the ef to mft and they both work brilliantly .
__label__positive__ nice
__label__positive__ excellent all around , speed , delivery , quality and exceptional transaction ! ! ! ! yes !
__label__neutral__ the case itself is great , but it does not fit what it says it does blade will not fit in case
__label__positive__ it is so worth it buy these drones . do n't let the confusing manual stop you , once you get it going and adjusted , it 's awesome to fly and so much fun especially with a gopro .
__label__positive__ perfect ! should have ordered it long ago !
__label__positive__ the real deal !
__label__neutral__ not practical on a daily basis , but could come in handy in an emergency if i can find it when i need it and remember how to use it. < br / > very loud . we bought two in case one did not work for us -- and both are pretty extreme . good price
__label__positive__ not exactly what was described in description as it is from a different name , but same item . not a big deal to me as i wanted the colors and function to be there . i have a 600d and this holds no problem with the pack added to the 600d . it does not come with weights , so these would be an additional purchase . several places carry the weights . i did have my eye on a much more stable jib but after a few test runs on this , it is n't bad . i like the lightweight , portability function and it comes with a bag that is of quality. < br / > < br / > i do see where at full extension there could be some bow , but i have n't experienced this . i had my rokinon c-m 85mm , full rail system ( focus , matte box , battery packs , monitor , lights ) at full extension without bow . i am going to try with my old cannon xl2 and see what it does .
__label__positive__ works very well in light or day light .
__label__positive__ really helpful
__label__positive__ great quality product . does everything that i want from a circular polarizer . breakthough photography is emerging as a big player in the photography filter market . i am pleased !
__label__positive__ i 've had this item for about a year now , and have ended up using it considerably more often than originally intended . i mostly shoot architecture so i typically do n't use a softbox except in special situations ( or for the occasional portrait ) , but because this folds down so easily i decided to take it on a few home shoots and kept bringing it back to more shoots because it offered more control than a bounce umbrella . if neewer offered a softbox with dual flash mounts , i 'd buy that too. < br / > < br / > so far this softbox has held up very well . i misplaced a couple of the clips that hold the baffle in , but replaced those with some tiny s-biners from home depot . no issues at all with material quality , and i 've removed and reattached the metal speedring many times without any noticeable deterioration of the fabric where the speedring mounts . awesome value .
__label__positive__ i liked the tiny size of the selfie stick when it was brought back down into its smallest size . it all folded back on itself so that it is just just a slender stick that will fit easily into a bag or pocket. < br / > < br / > the length of it when extended was 73 cm . add that to the length of your arm and you have an excellent range of distance for taking a selfie . it ’ s easy enough to take a portrait or landscape photo simply by the way you orient the handle of the selfie stick allowing you to take an almost full body shot of yourself. < br / > < br / > the only minor negative i would have to say about the device was the charging cord . i found it a little flimsy and actually bent it the first time i inserted it into the handle to charge it . i was afraid i had broken it but to my pleasant surprise the cord seems to be quite durable once i straightened it out , it worked just fine and hasn ’ t given me any problems since . i ’ m just a little more careful when i plug it in . the best thing about charging the selfie stick is that it only takes a short 30 minutes to get it charged. < br / > < br / > the selfie stick was light but still felt sturdy . the grip was comfortable to hold . the grip for the phone is a sliding spring-loaded bracket so it will hold any size phone very snuggly . there is also a strap to wrap around your wrist so you don ’ t risk losing your phone by dropping the stick. < br / > < br / > everything about this selfie stick is so easy from the way you mount the phone to the way the phone connects to the stick through bluetooth. < br / > < br / > i received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review . if it were possible to give 4.5 stars i would , so i ’ ll have to round it up to 5 .
__label__positive__ this film has been good so far ! i have n't used all the film , so i do n't know if there are any blanks . film is very expensive , and this is no exception , but comparatively , it 's a pretty good price .
__label__positive__ build quality and fit : < br / > 30 inches in length and folds up in 8 inches . not very pocketable , but very much pursable and backpackable. < br / > the stick is quite rigid . the stainless steel rod does flex at full length but the strength should accommodate even large phones on the market from 2.5 inches to as wide as 3.5 inches . which will clearly accommodate an iphone 6 plus or a galaxy s6 . i found that even when i had my thick wallet case , that the bracket had no problems with holding onto the phone . the bracket that grips the phone with a spring loaded mechanism . it has rubber grommets that wo n't scratch your phone -- i had my iphone 5 on there naked without thinking it 'll scratch . it grips securely even with intensive physical movement . the handle is has soft rubberized grip that allows much more grip especially when hands are cold or wearing thick gloves. < br / > < br / > features : < br / > bluetooth offers the ability to take photos by the press of the button but i found myself using the timer on my phone 's camera app since turning on my bluetooth is already a two step process . plus , it 's one less thing to charge and clog our 2.4ghz bandwidth . the bottom of the stick is where you charge the bluetooth device via microusb . there is only a 60mah battery so charge time is very quick & # 60 ; 20mins. < br / > < br / > i 'd never though i 'd use & # 34 ; selfie-stick & # 34 ; because the thought of using these in public puts me off . although you can be courteous and ask someone near by to take a photo , it is n't always the best solution . what if you 're with a group and there is n't someone nearby to take a photo ? a common solution would be that someone from the group would be left out at take the photo . so i guess there is a use for & # 34 ; selfie-sticks & # 34 ; .
__label__positive__ i love the shiny metallic effect on this film .
__label__positive__ i love this lens ! it has a great zoom range and is super clear !
__label__positive__ i bought this to take on a couple of cruises so i do n't have to take my dslr , which would devastate me if it were lost or stolen . this little camera is amazing . my husband and i went out with both cameras and you can not tell which one took which picture . the detail in each picture is incredible . the zoom really can get you in close . my one complaint is that the battery life is very short . i was using this with the & # 34 ; creative shot & # 34 ; and it only lasted about an hour or about 50 shots . so , be sure to have plenty of batteries with you if you are going out for a day of shooting . but it sure can be a lot of fun to have . i now carry it in my purse - which i ca n't do with the dslr - to have a camera ready any time i want to be able to take some quick pics .
__label__positive__ i am a free-lance professional photographer ; love the resultas of this film
__label__neutral__ this does not fit and sd card , it is xd picture card and they are super expensive for a 32mg , they only have up to 2 gb as far as i could see . i got a good deal for a 32 gb micro sd card on amazon and im gon na get a xd to micro sd adapter for it as well , im looking at 10 $ for both on e-bay buy it now option . also if you do decide to do this , the adapter is for this camera olympus fe-370 , ive seen lots of comments that it doesnt even work on some fe series . so do lots of research people !
__label__negative__ selfie stick does not fit properly
__label__positive__ work well !
__label__positive__ i cant say enough about this little camera . what a deal . its awesome ! ! ! . i took pictures and they came out great ! and video is outstanding ! . i really cant say anything bad about this purchase . i ca n't wait to get it mounted on my helmet and take it out for a ride ! !
__label__positive__ dual suction lets it suck right onto the door . great for capturing videos while driving ! and if you use some force wo n't even shake !
__label__positive__ great camera ! great price ! good response for my questions ! very happy with delivery !
__label__positive__ great lens to have .
__label__negative__ device arrived and when i tried to connected to the computer via the usb cord provided , it said device not recognized and error in installing software . so could never use it !
__label__positive__ grate i wish i can fine more seniors though lol .
__label__positive__ very nice quality , had to return it and was given a refund .
__label__positive__ great back up flash
__label__positive__ love it . it takes awesome headshots .
__label__negative__ bought it after i got my go pro hero 4 black . i did n't want to spend much anymore and i saw it has good review . sounds like a good deal however if you get what you pay for. < br / > the selfie stick does n't last . i used it almost every day during my 2 weeks vacation . not even a week using it , the selfie stick broke down . also , it turns on itself so that is something to think about. < br / > the car mount was disappointing , it did n't even hold . it will hold if you put it on the windshield but the car itself no ! . < br / > the bike mount , well it did a good job so far but i used it once. < br / > the chest / head mount looks like is not broken so far as i did n't use it extensively as the selfie stick. < br / > < br / > the selfie stick and car mount is not recommended if you were to ask me .
__label__negative__ lighting is good , mount interferes with lenses auto focus ability , manual use off mount required for good results .
__label__positive__ works as expected . no problem connecting to the contacts or staying on the flash or camera once tightened down and installed .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ wasabi ! it 's green stuff and it 's good to eat on sushi and to open up your sinuses . pack that into a battery and bammmm ! ! ! it 's amazing ! i first used wasabi power batteries for my canon t2i , now these with my canon 5d mark ii . i know for sure that the wasabi power for my t2i last longer than the stock canon battery . with the 5d mark ii i am unsure . i do n't count my shutters on each battery and i barely care about the battery gauge on my camera . to me , being unsure if i get more or less shots from the wasabi only means that it must be somewhat comparable to the stock canon battery right ? i would say so . and in the future i will update this post if i notice a dramatic difference between batteries .
__label__negative__ the softbox works well , but beware that the plastic mount is not the highest quality . mine broke just under the tilt adjustment knob . luckily it has a 1/4 & # 34 ; -20 threaded hole that i can still use it without having to macgyver it back together . the bag it comes with is nice , and aside from it breaking , i really like it and use it regularly . i would have given this at least 3 stars had it lasted longer than 3 weeks of daily use ...
__label__positive__ excellent product for an excellent price . works perfect with my lee system .
__label__negative__ terrible purchase
__label__positive__ love it . wish it was 5 inches longer though !
__label__positive__ it 's great in the sunshine . it ca n't perform well under low light situation ... i ca n't even take photo in a japanese sushi bar with this lens.. i use my f4 lens instead in such situation .
__label__positive__ great quad ! i 'm a former dji pilot and i love the yuneec . stable , quiet , well made and well thought out . easy to fly and allows you to take great pics and videos .
__label__neutral__ i was so excited about the specifications of this camera but sorely disappointed after shooting with it for a while . the sharpness of the images has been a problem for many including myself . while it does improve a little with raw it still really is n't that good . my indoor shooting was very disappointing . i was blown away that my olympus xz-2 was capable of higher image quality even with the much smaller sensor . bottom line , i gave this camera away to one of the kids for their hiking adventures , which it may actually be good for , and switched back to my olympus pen .
__label__neutral__ i purchased two different tv simulators and honestly prefer the other model , which had a wider range of color and light changes , over this one . this one works okay and i will still use it in another room when needed , but the the other simulator looks more authentic from outside at night .
__label__positive__ product was exactly as described and everything works perfect . i even received a follow up call just to be sure i was pleased with my purchase . thank you !
__label__negative__ trash merchandise . the dozen bty batteries that i purchased too only a dozen charges at best .
__label__positive__ i 'm very happy with this backpack . i am going to europe and wanted a backpack to carry my camera gear . i packed my canon eos rebel , four lenses ( including a 600mm telephoto ) , two lens hoods and miscellaneous other gear inside plus my slik tripod strapped to the back and took it out for a test walk . the pack is very comfortable and distributes the weight evenly between my shoulders and hips . i like the way the way two of the tripod feet fit into a foldout pouch at the bottom . at the top is another small compartment containing an adjustable strap that secures the top end of the tripod just below the head . it felt very secure and it was easy to load and unload the tripod. < br / > < br / > the arrangement of padded compartments inside the back work well for my gear . i found it easy to access my camera and lenses quickly. < br / > < br / > it works wonderfully for what i need .
__label__positive__ great accessories
__label__positive__ i am satisfied with the product .
__label__neutral__ i gave this item only three stars for the two & # 34 ; cons & # 34 ; listed below ; the & # 34 ; pros & # 34 ; can be found in other helpful reviews , as those are what led me to purchase this model. < br / > < br / > - only accepts a 32gb card ; would have given it another star if it took a bigger card. < br / > - once it begins recording ( video ) , it turns off when it 's picked up and buttons are pressed ; if you 're trying to catch someone doing something they 're not supposed to , hope it is n't someone curious about this clock and its features. < br / > < br / > overall , it 's a good product and accomplishes what it 's supposed to ... for the most part .
__label__positive__ great price ! love this strap ! easy to attach to my nikon d5000 . adjustable . makes walking around with my camera feel like it 's part of my accessories rather than looking like a tourist . a fun addition and super functional .
__label__positive__ easy to use . slides can be viewed clearly . old negatives not so much .
__label__neutral__ decent product . not overly impressed by anything. < br / > < br / > price is solid for what you are getting , dont expect anything rugged for you adventure selfie takers out there . i use this for my gopro so i did the accessory add on ( which was free ) to be able to mount a gopro . i have now superglued it to the pole instead of just screwing it on . the screw on worked but the weight of the gopro would cause it to slowly unscrew while you were using it so it could definitely be a recipe for losing a $ 500 go pro if not glued. < br / > < br / > the angles you can get are amazing . its also just absolutely obnoxious so i highly recommend taking it everywhere and making strangers worried that they have been included in the photo journal of your life .
__label__positive__ just what i need for my 1st aid kit
__label__positive__ great product , would buy it again if i had to ...
__label__positive__ these eyepieces are probably one of the best values available.every amateur should consider this set .
__label__positive__ i am satisfied with my purchase , with this being my first refurbished product . the only thing that i was missing was a lens cover , the aa batteries that was n't in the box was not a big deal who does not have aa batteries in their house . overall i am satisfied with my purchased .
__label__negative__ had to return it . opening is 1 3/4 & # 34 ; not 2 & # 34 ; !
__label__positive__ a little tight
__label__positive__ so much nicer than my 3rd party grips .
__label__neutral__ plastic feels okay not the best
__label__positive__ i read many reviews before deciding on this camera - works great , made the right choice !
__label__positive__ tried it out , was as expected . a bit on the heavy , you 'll need a good tripod . mine was a bit light . the tripod was great for heavy camera , but tripped over when i attached the celestron . so now im buying a tripod , enjoyed the celestron view
__label__positive__ great filters and macro lenses . i use them with my nikon 5200 and they work great . i am using the filters with my camera and my wife 's camera a nikon 3300 . recommend the product . for macro lenses i would recommend to get the 52 mm 0.35x altura with macro lens . i got it after getting this set and i am very impressed with it .
__label__positive__ easy to use above and below water . there are two particular features that i believe make this the best bobber . the first is that the grip is easy to hold and the second is that the wrist strap is attached securely to the bottom . you can reach the gopro with your hand in the strap and it is n't coming off . i do n't like the others where the strap has to be wrapped around the top before you attach the gopro. < br / > < br / > my only criticism is that the black handle makes it a little more difficult to see in the water so i think more yellow would be better . be aware that the majority of the bobber is under the water when it floats so you only see the top inch or so sticking out .
__label__negative__ terrible..just terrible ... i bought three camera 's and could not even get one to hook up to the wifi . even the tech support ( unfortunately one over worked person in california ) could not even fix . sending back .
__label__positive__ child using it really likes it . is very useful for keeping the little instant pictures from being lost .
__label__positive__ work better than expected . the macro lens is awesome !
__label__neutral__ for recording video , it 's more trouble than it 's worth . i bought this two years ago and never used it once . it does work , but the refresh is slow and it intermittently loses connection with the ipad . one of those things that wastes more time to use than it actually helps .
__label__positive__ good price and long lasting .
__label__positive__ works well with the most acra-swiss mounts ... nice compact design does n't block battery door on most of my cameras .
__label__positive__ perfect size for what i needed . not overly stuffed so it does n't take up too much room in the camera bag .
__label__positive__ easy to breathe , gets nice steady footage ! < br / > i use it bodysurfing
__label__positive__ the case is great . i use it for sensitive medical equipment and it does the job wonderfully . have flown with it on multiple occasions and everything arrives perfectly intact . super tough , easy to travel with . foam inserts are easy to customize to your needs . would def recc for transporting fragile equipment .
__label__positive__ wow ! ! ! i love this bag ! 1st , however , allow me to update the product info ... the acpro840w does not have the 'internal memory card storage pockets ' like the acpro650 ... it does have them , but they are part of a nylon divider wall in the front pocket ... that being said , they are way too small to be of any use ( i can not find a single thing that can fit in them except a memory card , but believe me you would never want to put one in them as you would have a heck of a time getting it back out ) , but that really does n't seem to matter much as the pocket with the divider is plenty roomy enough . also , it has mesh pockets on both sides but i have n't seen that mentioned anywhere . i bought this as we are about to go to the american southwest for vacation and i knew i would need a bag like this to take my camera and gear with me on the many , many hikes we are sure to take , so i will be sure to update this review after our return to rate it 's practical use while out in the field , so to speak . i packed the bag with what i feel i will need and this is what i 've found so far ... in the main compartment i can hold my nikon d5200 w/18-55mm lens attached with enough room below to store the lens hood , and both the wired and wireless remotes ... in the front pocket i store a 6-pack of various nd lens covers along with two extra batteries and a few clothes and a two extra batteries for my gopro ... in the top compartment ( i keep them divided ) i store my 55-200mm lens along with its hood , gopro camera on headband mount , my cell phone , keys and even wallet with room to spare ! ! ! all that and i can still access my camera in a second ! ! ! btw , i also store the rain cover in one side pocket and a camera rain sleeve in the other . again , i will update this review upon our return .
__label__positive__ cheap and work as expected for me
__label__negative__ it was a terrible product . it only shows the normal color if the room is welll lit and night vision would always be on when i used it . its also very had to turn the camera quickly . every time i watch my cats through it , i ca n't turn quick enugh to see if their fighting or not . this is n't a good product , and i suggest you dont get the camera
__label__positive__ it 's a solid camera . gets fuzzy when zooming in and out at times but does good work all the same and easy to upload files on any computer .
__label__positive__ perfect thank you
__label__positive__ with out a doubt one of the best cameras on the market .
__label__positive__ fits perfectfly with the gopro hero 4 black .
__label__positive__ i am an amateur , but i love photography . i now have a lens that gives me the ability to get great micro shots . i love it , and i got it in 2 days . bonus ! !
__label__positive__ very cute
__label__positive__ outstanding service , very fast delivery , item exactly as described ( fit my nikon d5200 perfectly ) . thank you ! !
__label__negative__ there is rusted nail ! ! ! ! it is new but i do n't know how long they 've had this . the box is all dusty and old .
__label__negative__ used this for a while with my pinhole camera . fell apart after about a month of use . cable separated from the metal on both ends .
__label__positive__ for what its worth , this head is an excellent value . i was surprised at the sturdiness and stability it offers . it is small and lightweight and would be ideal for sliders . its also ideal for unmanned cameras simply parked on a tripod . however , this is where the positives end . this thing is practically useless for any sort of movement . even simple adjustments during shooting are going to be awkward . the problem is there are really only two settings for adjustment : securely tight and totally loose . i tried doing a few test pans and tilts ... no good . i would be surprised if anyone could manage a single smooth move . i would n't even use this if you expect to do any active adjustments or moves while shooting . thing is , for $ 30 , it is well made and exceeds expectations . i guess you ca n't expect too much at that price .
__label__positive__ gives my leica d1 more of a film rangefinder look . does the job .
__label__positive__ very versatile . i use two of these in my house . easily connects to any android or ios device . video quality and low light is excellent. < br / > downsides : & # 34 ; cloud storage & # 34 ; connecting is specifically to ftp , not a dropbox or google drive . also , the motion detection tends to set itself off randomly- even when sensitivity lowered and masked to sections of the the frame- do n't rely on this for home alarms. < br / > upsides : affordable , easy , no monthly fees , good video quality , good night vision .
__label__negative__ inside the plastic ball and socket connectors is a soft metal rod . the end of the rod is threaded and screws into the flash shoe . at the plate end , it is held in place by two screw studs ( can be seen in product image ) . both ends , particularly at the plate , create potentially sharp angles that rapidly weaken the internal rod . to the point , i thought this thing was awesome at first as it easily held my sb-r200 flashes with mini softbox diffusers attached at any angle i tried . however , the metal rod broke at the base on one side the first time i used it . i reattached it with epoxy , but the second time i used it , the rod broke in the other arm at the flash shoe connection . unfortunate , as it seemed like a great piece of macro gear at first .
__label__positive__ great product . high picture quality . though screen resolution is not that good but photos are of very good quality . fast shipping .
__label__positive__ system is a good system . but i also had 3 of the 4 cameras that would not work and had the factory replace them . 1 of the 3 replacements would not work so had to get that replaced also . revo was very helpful and willing to fix the issues . would recommend this system and hope that no one have the bad luck with the cameras .
__label__positive__ excelent
__label__positive__ i do n't know what i would do without this now that i have it ! do note this is for sd cards and not cf cards . i simply flip my cards upside down once they 've been used . the bottom pockets are a bit stiffer and one has a tag over it which can be annoying at times , but this has made my life so much more organized !
__label__positive__ why do these always get lost ? well , at least they are easy to replace .
__label__positive__ when you see the profoto name i know 2 things to almost always to be true : i will get high quality ( check ) at a high price ( check ) . this is a great octabox regardless of the $ $
__label__neutral__ great
__label__negative__ pakcage broke
__label__positive__ fantastic camera . excellent photos , works with the lens i have that were made by cannon !
__label__positive__ i love it .
__label__positive__ i would prefer that the adjustment bands be more firmly attached to the strap . looks a little suspect whether it can actually withstand 15 pound camera . very comfortable .
__label__positive__ replaced some defective ones wit no set up problems easy . works well .
__label__positive__ wasabi is the best in battery value , reliable , better milliamp-hour rating then original and less than half the price with a travel charger !
__label__positive__ only used this once . no start up instructions , finally figured it out .
__label__positive__ works as designed
__label__positive__ was what i needed
__label__positive__ after 4 years i love my camera i 've taken thousand of pictures and video . dropped it a year ago and flash does n't work anymore but still takes great picture . hoping to graduate to nikon dslr soon
__label__positive__ i use this camera for snorkeling , body boarding , hiking , pictures , and it has great quality of video and is easy to use with mounts . get the chesty for water .
__label__negative__ one week in costa rica and the humidity literally rusted it and trashed it . you get what you pay for . this is a real pos .
__label__positive__ great value and the yard signs look professional while the window stickers stand out well with the red color . highly recommended .
__label__negative__ took longer to set up then indicated . upon contacting support when it got stuck updating was told it would take 30-40 minutes to update itself . only had it for 4 days and it was offline 2 of the days i had it ( for no apparent reason , wi-fi was still working and all other connected devices were working ) . good looking piece of tech but needs more development . when it did work it was great , good picture quality and alerted when my daughter stopped by and i was not there . but there was no way to get it back on line until i got home . there are other devices that preform the same function for half the $ $ $ .
__label__positive__ love it thank you
__label__positive__ this is a great selfie stick ! after going through a few of them , i 've finally found a sturdy , light and compact stick that is easy to travel with but still gets the job done . i love that it can hold my iphone 6 plus with no problem . finally something that works as described .
__label__positive__ very easy to use and very effective also . if you slop food on it , you might need something different , but if you are not a sloppy eater you are good to go . easy to fit in your bag .
__label__positive__ love it ! wish i had bought it sooner .
__label__positive__ great ! snug fit , very heavy duty case .
__label__negative__ mine came malfuctioned
__label__positive__ small , but large enough that i can find it . even the dark .
__label__positive__ great product at an excellent price . overall a good experience .
__label__positive__ the pack rocks , i have purchased 2 more and- 2- 360 light units at 72 years old i no longer have a desire to carry heavy light sets and stands . everything goes into one rolling case stands , lights , boxes , brellas , etc cables , and packs . everything i need
__label__negative__ this camera is defective and cameta camera is very uncooperative in helping resolve the issue . it was purchased for my son as a graduation gift who will be leaving the country for two years and i will not be able to send this camera with him . i will end up having to purchase another camera from someone else . i would not purchase this , or any , product from this company again . **after contacting nikon directly i was advised the problem with my camera is caused by the memory card . the memory card sold in this bundle by cameta camera is not compatible with this camera . i will purchase another memory card and that should resolve the problem .
__label__negative__ can not get them to work . only works with outdated web browser
__label__positive__ i got this free when purchasing my nikon d750 . i did n't really need it but now that i have it , i am glad that i have it . it is nice when i know that i only need to take a few lens and possibly a speedlight with me on a shoot . it was also great for when we traveled . it helped us not bring attention to the fact that we were carrying thousands of dollars in the bookbag .
__label__positive__ clear viewing . adjustable eye cups are nice .
__label__negative__ did not have a universal fit like it describes . my cool pics and easyshare did n't fit . i returned for my money .
__label__positive__ great . just what i was looking for .
__label__positive__ perfect , no problems at all .
__label__positive__ iv hade it about six months and it works fine but i 'm starting to lose the color ... i 'll let you know more about the cameras later.it 's not real high quality but it gets the job done.goodnight quality out till about 50 to 60 feet ...
__label__positive__ great camera and ended up giving it to my daughter . i wanted it to replace my old camera but it did not fit in the waterproof housing . back to looking : - ) she took a lot of pictures on it in hawaii and never failed her once . hope it last her a while but it was a great price for a camera and a great camera
__label__positive__ perfect , just a bit difficult to mount and get off . but a necessity to work outside .
__label__positive__ good amount of accessories . some seem a little cheap . i mainly bought this kit for the case that it came with . i did use the yellow attachment for water activities . it worked nicely however after i noticed that water had a accumulated inside . the chest harness seems good quality and so is the head strap .
__label__positive__ aperlite yh-500n < br / > < br / > i was given the aperlite yh-500n to review , on receiving the flash i found it was very well pack when i opened the box . the flash felt strong & well made , i honestly though it was going to feel like a cheap plastic one but i was very surprised when holding the flash in my hand. < br / > i put the flash though some tests along side my nikon sb900 and i have to say the flash performed extremely well . the first thing i notice was how easy it was to find the setting you need i really was impressed with this . controlling the power of the flash was quick and easy . there was plenty of power in the flash to light up the background with a distances in the shots , then with a quick tap on the dial you can switch to less power to get some great creative shots . having ttl in the flash works fantastic i have no issues with that side of things at all. < br / > i also tried the aperlite yh-500n as off the camera flash from the main light to a fill in flash i was so happy with both results the flash gave me everything i needed out of this flash . it works with flash triggers and as slave unit with no problems . if your looking for a flash at a small price i would highly recommend this one . i am a nikon user throughout and only use nikon stuff but i can honestly say this flash head will stay in my bag and will be used a lot . the only thing i would like to have seen with this flash is a diffuser hood i had to use one of my spare ones but you can get them cheap of amazon or ebay but would have been nice to have got one with the flash. < br / > < br / > so my over hall review for the aperlite yh-500n < br / > < br / > 1 , build well ( do n't feel like a cheap flash ) < br / > 2 , performs as it says < br / > 3 , easy to find the setting you need < br / > 4 , very reliable < br / > 5 , great flash for the money < br / > 6 , i rate this flash 8 out of 10
__label__positive__ it was a little hard to figure out at first but it worked out great once i got the hang of all the adjustments and quick release plate . my jib gets in today i ca n't wait to see how this holds up !
__label__positive__ i have an arris x-speed fpv 250 quad that came with a & # 34 ; board camera & # 34 ; which is not nearly as good as this one is . it is heavier due to the metal case that is one draw back , however it is well protected . i will be buying another of these. < br / > great camera for the money !
__label__negative__ poor quality
__label__positive__ i was n't to sure about buying this set of mounts just because it was so cheap and there are so many goods but i 'm glad i did . seemed a little too good to be true . i not only have an excellent new chest harness , but a mini tripod , selfie pole , hand grip , suction mount , headstrap , and the list goes on and one . all of the items are made from rugged abs plastics , with metal core and metal threads/screws/nuts，the chest mount is awesome and works for me skiing/riding any other outdoor sports
__label__positive__ i have been a long time dslr user , with film before that and so far i have found the sony a7ii to be a great camera . delivers great sharp photos , easy to carry and shoot with a number of settings . the information in that you can display on the back of the camera and in the viewfinder makes creating a a good photo very easy. < br / > < br / > the package from focus camera worked out very well with all the accessories you could need to get a quick start using this camera . best idea is to charge-up all the batteries as soon as the package arrives and while you are getting familiar with the camera . that 's one of the great things about this package is that you will have three batteries and a 64gb card ( 2400 pictures shooting raw ) . given the fact that this is the same price as the camera with lens alone , it would be crazy not to order the package if available .
__label__negative__ after taking this item out of the packaging i found that the white background was stained by the blue and green backgrounds . i thought i could keep it to create a pattern for making nicer muslin backdrops , even though none of the backdrop velcro lines up well with the velcro on the box . finally one of the metal springs on the box had some cheapy silver paint chip off and there 's rust flakes staining the sides of the box . 2 stars since at least the seams have held up so far .
__label__positive__ very good made . i recommend this product .
__label__positive__ i love this flash , helps me take great pics !
__label__neutral__ i have heard a lot of people say it 's as good as the rode video mics . the sound quality is not as good and the vibration dampeners are so stiff that every vibration transfers to the microphone . it 's still a good mic and fairly well-built . a great value but not a replacement for a rode. < br / > < br / > also , some reviewers claim it works without batteries which is not true . it requires a single aa battery and the battery cover is a pain to remove. < br / > < br / > you get what you pay for , nothing in this price range comes close .
__label__negative__ these batteries are not good at all . they hold a charge a fraction of the time of the regular battery .
__label__positive__ great product wish i could my latest video ! if you want step up your time lapse game get this ! ! !
__label__positive__ sort of cheap but stores my camera and accessories
__label__positive__ i have been testing the cameras , now can suggest that aly004 with onvif technology is faster than p2p camera , the wifi setup is easier configure with lan cable using the software or the app , for now setup throught browser its not avaible . the camera works perfect
__label__neutral__ good concept , but the post and & # 34 ; ball head & # 34 ; are kind of cheaply constructed . the base is ok .
__label__positive__ the tripod is perfect for my needs . compact and pretty sturdy considering its size .
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__negative__ do not buy any of their products ! i purchased and received this product on 6/7/16 and today is 7/16/16 and its already not displaying pictures , will not reset to default , does not recognize the remote control . it was working perfect the first couple of weeks and recently noticed that the frame either is on the menu or completely powered off . i have never purchased anything that goes to crap this soon after purchasing . but i have added nixplay as a company and product to stay away from .
__label__neutral__ ac adapter died a few weeks after the warranty expired but besides that ; its a great camera .
__label__positive__ the magnet keeps falling off : /
__label__positive__ great product.. amazing pictures !
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ this must have been the easiest screen protector i have put on . it has no bubbles creases , dust . it was easy peasy . no joke it was the best i have ever bought , and i have bought some . if i need any more this is the place . brilliant product .
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid:4e5378e0281f47c611de0ff2691f856 ] ] great build quality and features . nice choice of viewing angles for those that are not fond of the fish eye effect . has zoom option which is nice when you need it . i like the modular design of the lcd screen or extra battery . comes with a nice array of accessories , even a curved 3m stick panel for helmets . the lcd has a blue tint but the footage once uploaded onto a proper screen it looks amazing . i took a rifle class over the weekend and caught some footage . i could only upload 30seconds due to amazon 100mb file limit , and i wanted to keep 1080p resolution . but the video does its job , the footage is absolutely outstanding . keep in mind this is also with the waterproof housing on ( which is why the audio is a bit muted ) . 4k is pretty good too but 15 fps is a bit laggy for my tastes , but the 1080p @ 60 fps is great . it also has wifi so you can connect with your phone to check viewing angles . the menu is a bit confusing at first but a few minutes of experimentation is all that 's needed . all in all a decent little camera . i compared some specs and this camera is better than the gopros except the hero 4 black .
__label__positive__ package arrived ahead of expected delivery date . all items were as described .
__label__positive__ just what i was look for . great buy .
__label__neutral__ image quality is very good and the camera is very responsive - when it connects remotely . sometimes it connects immediately ( 30 % ) , and sometimes it will not connect to a remote mobile device at all ( 70 % ) . < br / > < br / > the greatest fault is it does not tilt down . if you mount it high ( like in the corner of a room ) , you will not be able to view down into the room .
__label__positive__ great filter !
__label__positive__ plenty sturdy exactly what i wanted and did n't break the bank !
__label__positive__ good quality and went on first time .
__label__positive__ well designed and made . excellent value for money and
__label__positive__ works great right out of the box , ca n't wait to use it more !
__label__negative__ performs very very badly as a slave unit . dont buy !
__label__positive__ great charger , great battery 's , specially for the price ! !
__label__negative__ video sucks even with a decent card blurry and strobo lines . battery life such to .
__label__positive__ i love the clarity for such a low price . it is my go to lense for most things now .
__label__positive__ i really like it alot . my first big girl lens ... lol
__label__positive__ this lens is so worth it . it simply clips onto your phone over the phones camera lens . there are 2 options to choose from . either a macro ( close-up lens , or wide angle ( pushes things back ) lens . to attach the lenses , all you have to do is screw them on . to get a wider angle , screw all pieces onto the clip . to get a macro view , only screw on the macro lens , which is labeled and is the smaller of the 2 . it is pretty straight forward and easy to use . so , attach the lens of your choice and enjoy the shots you get with your camera phone . received this product for review .
__label__negative__ battery never worked so have n't been able to test it .
__label__positive__ battery works great , i have taken over 350 pictures with one while on vacation and its still running strong ! charger was guicker than i had excpected wich is always a plus . and the mini tripod was a great little bonus that made setting up the timer and getting family photos in nice and easy
__label__positive__ if you were still on the fence about moving from your dslr to a mirrorless , it 's time to hop over . this little point and shoot looking camera has the capabilities of some of the best dslrs on the market but runs you only about a fraction a the cost . i 'm loving the 11fps and auto focus is fast af , and i do n't mean the camera acronym . it 's so amazing how much effort is saved just by bringing this little guy to events than an imposing mirrorfull camera . also , my girlfriend loves the white . it 's a nice littl change of pace from the black .
__label__negative__ one charging lead broke off within a month
__label__negative__ this is not for a police officer to use . garbage .
__label__positive__ ca n't use my camera without this ...
__label__positive__ it is a bit different from my other canons but i have learned that each time i get a new one i have to reteach myself but this one was fairly easy to pick up .
__label__positive__ this camera right out of the box was amazing ! ease of use gets an a++ and quality as well . the photos come out looking great. < br / > < br / > as for light control , there 's a dial on the lens that allows you to adjust the shutter speed to current light , & # 34 ; indoors , cloudy , partly cloudy , sunny , hi key & # 34 ; . < br / > < br / > although not your larger , & # 34 ; classic & # 34 ; , size photo , this is quite the camera for capturing memories in a way that does n't just pass you by like our thousands of photos on our phones.. i highly recommend this product to people looking to capture special events . used it for our first child 's baby shower and everyone was able to take a photo home for the memory . very nice experience for all !
__label__positive__ my canon hf-r300 camcorder shows over 200 minutes of battery life with this battery . my original was lasting about 20-30 minutes . this one makes the original battery look like junk . it is noticeably longer than the original and sticks out a little , but it is something i can learn to live with for the extra life . i 'll probably end up getting another .
__label__negative__ i did n't buy this through amazon . i 'm just sounding off from my experience with this product . the motion detector does n't detect a human walking over 10 feet away no matter what position it is in . i 'm taking it back to the big box store i bought it at .
__label__positive__ this is a fantastic camera for the price . the samsung wb1100f produces fantastic still and video . the 35x zoom is awesome ! battery life averages 90 minutes but i purchased four extra batteries . i just ordered a second samsung wb1100f . i do a lot of hiking and climbing into abandoned structures and this camera is light weight , making my gear bag lighter .
__label__positive__ fast , sharp , and an excellent prime lens addition to the truly splendid fujifilm x-mount lens lineup . not light , but superbly built with outstanding optical qualities . balances very nicely indeed on the x-t1 . i particularly like the clutch mechanism that enables the shift from auto-focus to manual . as with all the fast fujinon prime lenses , it is excellent in low light - especially in combination with the low-noise , high iso , settings available on the x-t1 .
__label__positive__ expected
__label__negative__ could never get the tf card for it !
__label__positive__ i wanted a fuji lens with reach to capture detail at a distance . the quality of the images surpassed my expectations . this is a significantly better lens than a nikon 70-300 zoom i used years ago on a nikon full frame camera .
__label__positive__ love the idea of being off the grid for tv . records and does everything a dvr is supposed to do . remote sucks . have had several issues with it , the manufacturer says i need new batteries ... no i do n't ! i have had several emails with different people so its never the same person , very frustrating . i also live 5 miles away from where they ship them out . why ca n't i just get a new remote ? smh !
__label__positive__ so here is the thing ... instax photos do n't print well . think back to 197ps poloroid ( but smaller ) however ... i knew that when i bought it and had seen the prints in person . so i knew that . i love the size and i love the washed out vintage look . poloroid instant printers print better ( like the pogo ) but if you want a small printer for quick pix the cannon selphy is the best quality ( it 's 4x6 prints but you can use apps to do all kinds of crops and borders cut them out ) . i have all three ! the instax prints super fast and is fun to watch develop . i am only giving it 4 stars because the wall chord is not included ( sold separately ) and at this price it should include the wall plug in .
__label__positive__ super
__label__positive__ installed very easily . just wish it was a bit smaller
__label__negative__ i have n't used them yet , but due to lack of description , i made the purchase based off the image . was in need of the same direction joint . while the longer extension is & # 34 ; same direction & # 34 ; both short ones unlike the picture , have the 90 degree change . the extension arm may help my issues , but i did not want to use solely this . i was in need of the short one as well . keeping the camera as close to the mount as possible helps limit vibration . had i known , the picture was not accurate , i would have sought alternative products . hopefully their at least durable .
__label__neutral__ i was not very happy with the quality of this lens . i have opted to use a rokinin 35mm f1.4 instead and am happier with the quality of the picture . perhaps the fact that i am not shooting with a full-frame sensor with the sony camera is to blame . when shooting with the mitakon fully open i had challenges with color casts ( mainly purple ) and barrel distortion .
__label__positive__ henry , he is professional tech , he help me to set up the camera .
__label__positive__ as advertised
__label__positive__ must have for shooting long exposures . can hold down in & # 34 ; bulb & # 34 ; exposure setting and the device has a lock on it so you can open the shutter , lock it , and walk away . allows you to take exposures of great lenght withouth manually holding the shutter open .
__label__positive__ everything came as advertised . great price and fast shipping . i definitely recommend this product !
__label__positive__ works perfectly !
__label__positive__ i 'm very happy with the purchase . all items work perfectly for my nikon d5200 camera . i think the assortment of the products was a very clever one . i recommend this product . many thanks .
__label__positive__ quick shipping , quick connexion to bluetooth & compatible with iphone 5 !
__label__positive__ super prompt with delivery . . .great items for on the road photo shoots .
__label__positive__ great inexpensive way to replace the original batteries .
__label__positive__ one of the best deals i 've ever gotten on these batteries !
__label__positive__ what can i say ? it 's a pelican . it 's awesome .
__label__positive__ perfect fit . happy to have a strap with it so i wo n't lose it again !
__label__positive__ very sturdy. < br / > i keep buying better and better tripods , but this is the only monopod i 've purchased .
__label__positive__ durable ... i have had a while now and banged it around plenty of times .
__label__neutral__ i liked the older version with more access to controls on outside of camera without having to always go into menu to change or adjust . overall though , it does take nice pictures .
__label__neutral__ makes the motor and iris very noisy and slow . but it works i guess
__label__positive__ works well as advertised . beware that disney parks do not allow it to be carried inside just like other parks . it can not fit in the pocket . but otherwise does its job well .
__label__positive__ perfect for canon eos m3
__label__positive__ this is a good replacement part , not quite as solid as the nikon hood but it does the job .
__label__positive__ takes very good pictures , easy to use , great zoom ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ great product . really ca n't beat cannon .
__label__positive__ everything came as ordered and works fine .
__label__positive__ works great , suction is strong . i have used it mounting my gopro to my mustang when racing and it 's never fallen off . even mounted to the side of my car it stays on .
__label__positive__ good but not perfect . this is an excellent pole and has a system of add-on poles for more length . they 're pricey , but the finish is excellent and they are waterproof . use in saltwater and rough abuse do n't phase this baby . that said , there needs to be an & # 34 ; l & # 34 ; attachment to make a good selfie stick as with the goodies from polarpro . in fact , team knekt , please make an & # 34 ; l & # 34 ; attachment so this can be the best stick out there .
__label__positive__ met my expectations !
__label__positive__ i just spent twice as much as usual for an expensive pair of eyeglass lenses . it was worth it but i want to maintain my investment . these fiber cloths are wonderful . they gently and completely clean my new lenses . love that they are individually packaged . i am going to have to reorder because i keep giving them out to close friends .
__label__positive__ absolutely love this lens for shooting the moon ! ! ! this lens requires a heavey duty tripod to mount . the lens is heavy , but with a good tripod it is very easy to operate . i have had this lens for several years and love it ! zooming out can be task to keep the subject in the view finder . the lens is a manual lens to focus . i have this on my sony a65 and it mounts perfectly and my camera works well with it . highly recommend this for shooting the moon ! ! !
__label__negative__ when i first got it , it would not focus at all . i had to take apart the lens elements and move them closer to the bottom of the tube till i could get it to focus . once i got it focusing , it worked just as good as i expected it would , not great , but better than nothting if you need a cheap 5x barlow .
__label__neutral__ my iphoneplus 6 would get drop out . it is not tight enough .
__label__positive__ they work great
__label__positive__ for the price this jib is amazing , this jib looks and feels durable and easy to carry , if you 're starting a filming combo this is the right tool to have , i use it with my nikon d3300 and it works great , the tripod i use is a professional heavy duty video camcorder tripod fluid drag head kits by fancierstudio , a cheap but very nice video tripod. < br / > < br / > look the picture and see how it looks , i use a ravelli atd professional tripod dolly for camera photo video too. < br / > < br / > happy buying ! ! !
__label__positive__ i took photography for several years in college and have a casual interest , though i 'm rusty , and am a novice in digital photography . i find i miss having a manual focus a lot . it 's frustrating getting the camera to focus on the subject sometimes , even when it 's in the middle of the frame . the zoom capabilities are pretty great for my needs and entertainment , and i can see the image stabilization really helping make it possible to take shots without a tripod . i was happy with the depth of field i was able to achieve in close up shots . the soda tab shows how close i was able to focus in without zoom . you can get objects right up to the lens , which was resting on the edge of the can in that shot. < br / > < br / > i did n't really like any of the & # 34 ; filters & # 34 ; that come on the camera , i did n't find any of them useful or even cool looking . my old canon eos that was stolen had way nicer filters on it . i also do n't understand why it defaults to saving a version of the photo with each filter , you should be able to pick one filter and save only that version of the photo. < br / > < br / > overall i 'm happy with this camera , although it really does n't have the frills i wish it did , and the frills it does have ( wifi enabled/filters ) i do n't really need . i 'm very happy with it as my first superzoom camera , it 's really fun and i look forward to taking it out on more hikes and camping trips .
__label__positive__ works perfectly .
__label__neutral__ i purchased this thinking it would work great , small compact and with onvif protocals just what i needed , but my system runs windows and it seems not compatible with windows os . i wish it was , i wish it was stated in the details.. otherwise it would be the best little black box around . i spoke to someone from jide tech and they said they would teamview with me to see what the problem was , & # 34 ; but i am still waiting. & # 34 ; i really do n't know what to say about this little black box , some of the other reviews swear by it . i can truthful say . i can see video from all my camera 's , it does n't take up a lot of space , but i ca n't copy the video file . if i need it to show cause or for evidence.. it 's a wash ca n't do it . maybe someone from tech needs to help out . maybe if they see this review they might look into it or state its not compatible with windows os . i do n't ... ask before you buy if you are a windows type of guy.. it has the potential of being the best little black box around ... . fix it guys . if they help with a fix i will update my review .
__label__positive__ + good size to fit many objects/products + easy to fold up + very light , so if you only need to move it around within the same area , you can just pick up the whole setup . + the whole point of these tents is to diffuse the light , and with that objective it works great . - since it had to be folded for shipping , the creases on the tent and backdrops are permanent . it makes your photo very ugly when it shows up in the background . so in this regard , it is only ideal for small objects that you can frame to not show the creases . while i ca n't do much for the tent , i 've replaced the backdrops with my own , such as a fur blanket . a velvety fabric also works great .
__label__positive__ the universal camera strap by camin is a great accessory for any camera . my girlfriend wanted something a little more stylish and comfortable for her sony camera and when she saw this strap she had to have it . installation is easy as the ends are the same size as the oem one but gets wider where it goes across your neck or shoulder . the inside of the strap is a very soft and comfortable suede material and the outer fabric is very durable . the ends are tightly stitched leather . all in all it looks and feels very premium and i can tell it will last a long time. < br / > < br / > it makes it easy to have the camera draped across your side like a purse for easy point and shoot for moments where there is a shot you dont want to miss if your not fast enough . i would highly recommend any of the 3 straps if you are looking for something to customize your camera while making it more comfortable to carry. < br / > < br / > i was supplied this product at a discount price in exchange for this honest and true review .
__label__positive__ very compact , great quality. < br / > would buy again !
__label__positive__ nothing to say about pelican
__label__positive__ work good for the money
__label__neutral__ pretty thin stuff
__label__positive__ great value . they are better than original .
__label__positive__ would buy again
__label__neutral__ it works .
__label__positive__ decent lens , build is better than previous model . i ca n't honestly tell a lot of difference in clarity or bokeh . focusing does seem to be a tad able to be done a bit closer in but nothing drastic . there is less noise so that is a plus . for a cheap lens you ca n't go wrong..
__label__positive__ christmas gift , my wife loved it .
__label__neutral__ i bought with my nikon 1 aw but the strap came with it . i kept for as back up but this one is too wide for nikon 1 i never use it .
__label__positive__ awesome drone .
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ good to have on hand and works well for my needs . thanks ! !
__label__positive__ its nice value for money
__label__negative__ polaroid camera came defective . tried multiple batteries still did not work . contacted seller he would not return or exchange the camera . $ 90 down the drain .
__label__positive__ kind of hard to figure out to install.took a while but is great to use.im 75 and grip slipping away because of arthritis.before i did it for real ( loose grip ) tried hanging from wrist with battery grip , canon xti could n't shake it loose , now feel better about not wrecking my camera , to much money to replace .
__label__positive__ bought this for my wife and she 's been having fun with the micro lens outside . works amazing , thanks .
__label__negative__ i have had this product for about a year now . pros : < br / > free cloud storage < br / > only records on motion < br / > cons : < br / > low quality < br / > constant disconnects < br / > slow to load camera < br / > < br / > overall i can not recommend this product . the connection is constant dropping , so when you need the camera you do n't have it . i have an outstanding wifi network , so i know that is not the issue . also very slow to log in when you need to see something quickly .
__label__positive__ fits a rx100 iii nicely
__label__positive__ pretty good for the money
__label__positive__ great mount . the black is a little shiny if that is something that matters to you . it fits right on to a tripod screw and my go pro slips right in easily . this is a pretty versatile mount and this is the second one i bought to make myself a go pro hand grip mount . will buy again if i need another one . i attached a picture of the mount i created with this product .
__label__positive__ this was my first lens , and was the catalyst for my photography love . it is a great price , and will suffice to any photographer 's needs ( in its focal range ) . it taught me some of the most important lessons i 've ever learned in the photographic realm . first , do n't fall into the marketing scheme . there 's many lenses in this price range that will provide beautiful images . canon just wants you to keep spending money on lenses that are not necessary for 95 % of the population , they are a business , not you 're friend . second , the first thing you should do as a photographer is find your style . identify what makes you unique and explore the vast cosmos of photography . do n't listen to single word of the pretentious glass snobs ' that are fixated on futile passions . like henri cartier bresson said , & # 34 ; sharpness is a bourgeois concept. & # 34 ; sorry if i ranted , but i wish i had known this going into the game . heres some photos i took with this great lens .
__label__neutral__ i have this on the olympus 45mm f.18 and it does n't really look good attached to the lens . it does do it 's job of protecting my lens from debris and lens flare but i 'll most likely end up replacing it with a higher qualit yone soon .
__label__positive__ great drone it comes with every thing advertised . it is a very light drone and has has a low and high power when the higher one has more turning ability and resists winds lots better . the lower power makes the drone very user friendly ; therefore if you do crash it , it it a very sturdy light design and when the motor gets stopped by an object the drone will automatically shut off power to that motor . there are no complaints besides the fight time and especially if you are inpatient you can buy the four pack that makes the fight time from 7 to 35 minutes . mine personally gets about 10 because i leave it in low mode and i do n't push the drone . the drone at first may go left or right on its own but the controller has a very simple to use tuner , that worked perfect for me . the throttle is a little touchy but not a problem for me personally . there is a 3d mode which you can do very cool flips in any direction , that makes any beginner look like a pro that takes little skill ( but no one has to know ( ; ) . of my collection this is my favorite and i love it , if you are looking to buy a drone buy this one ; it is very stable and is very easy to fly .
__label__positive__ it 's great !
__label__positive__ excellent case now i can keep all my parts together
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ work great . i use them for macro and studio photography . each to setup and take down .
__label__positive__ very handy .
__label__positive__ 9/3 update : used for a week on photo sessions on appledore island , me . the strap was great ! easy to carry camera with this attached ( nikon d5300 with tamron 18-300 ) . looking for neck relief on upcoming trip to italy .
__label__positive__ fantastic tech support . great camera
__label__positive__ awesome camera has multiple filters for one shot and uses some different angles for one shot. < br / > and capture photos very well .
__label__positive__ love my gopro . made some great youtube videos at beach and water park .
__label__positive__ this film is excellent quality !
__label__positive__ i left my old charger somewhere on an island . this one works like a charm and is much faster than the old one , to boot !
__label__positive__ just what i needed
__label__negative__ i was pleased to get it ; upon opening the package ; construction looked good and solid . it is extremely light and portable , as advertised . the very first time i extended the legs , however , one of them fell completely apart . i carefully put it back together but now must be extra careful whenever i extend it or else the same thing happens again . this is far the from cheapest travel tripod i could have gotten and so am disappointed with the quality .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__neutral__ looks more powerful than it is . i might as well used a small pair of binoculars . it was a birthday gift so i do n't want to be to critical ...
__label__positive__ very nice compact camera with a fantastic zoom ! no it does not take as good of pictures as our nikon slr camera . however , the slr stays home a lot while this little compact camera goes . it fits in a pocket nicely . it takes nice pictures . and all the wireless transfer features are great too . i can be at a location with no cell phone signal , and yet transfer a photo to another person 's smartphone very easily . love it !
__label__negative__ it was working now it keeps disconnecting . i dont know whats going on
__label__positive__ fits perfectly
__label__positive__ they shipped it one day early which i was surprise and used it work nice and the mouth are very stable when i was driving it capture all views
__label__positive__ a mix up at first , i got a charger fitting a casio and not a lumix . i returned it and they ( blue nook ) sent me the correct one . it was done quickly and efficiently . i would use blue nook again for their fine customer service . the product itself works as described .
__label__negative__ this is a nice case for the money , however , the camera i purchased it for doea not fit . it was advertised on the same page as the camera . i also checked the camera measurements with the case and measurement wise it should hve fit .
__label__positive__ the product was as expected , and i was able t register it on nikon support website without an issue . i lens is sharp and works great with my d7200 . having the uv filter as part of the bundle saved me a lot of time and money .
__label__positive__ excellent product for the price
__label__positive__ i use this for all my batterys and it works perfect with no problems . will recommend this to anyone .
__label__positive__ good . sturdy product . used it a few times and the screw loosens up a tiny bit but not enough to drop your gopro .
__label__positive__ work great .
__label__negative__ dropcam is far and away superior .
__label__positive__ i love this tripod paired with my manfrotto mvh502ah and my canon g30 i do n't think there 's a better setup for the money when it comes to videography . i 'm an amateur who films my 16 year old daughter for soccer and us youth futsal events around the country . i would like to find a small lightweight system solid enough to film for traveling on flights , but dragging this huge tripod and fluid head has produced great films ... no what can i say : )
__label__negative__ i was very excited to find a reasonably priced trail camera with all the added features . when i got the product i was very disappointed the remote did not work . i tried to bypass that and the screen would flash on and off i tried to put new batteries in and it did the same thing . i guess you get what you pay for and unfortunately that was n't much .
__label__positive__ a little thiner than my original . but no loss of signal .
__label__negative__ its not waterproof . i did send it back and they gave it a & # 34 ; coutesy repair & # 34 ; , and then i went in the water with it again , not more than a foot deep this time ... ... and i 've still got a worthless $ 180 piece of crap that does n't do anything .
__label__positive__ great budget flash with plenty of features and solid construction for the price .
__label__positive__ works . could be a little clearer
__label__positive__ am happy with product and would buy again
__label__positive__ would highly recommend !
__label__negative__ not really rfid capable , ordered these along with other key fob reader ones for our pool gate system , i have updated our system to the latest greatest technology , tried these on my old system did not work , tried on my new system none of them worked had our installer try on several systems none of them worked , all different readers , systems , used multiple cards none worked . requesting refund
__label__positive__ great product . fun to use with backpack touch screen .
__label__positive__ best of pictures with clear view .
__label__positive__ i love this selfie stick ! it connects thru bluetooth and makes taking pictures super easy ! plus i like that it folds up so small and fits in my purse . perfect. < br / > ( i received this product for free in return for a review . all ideas are my own and the review is based on my opinions . )
__label__neutral__ it was a gift . she liked it
__label__positive__ love this camera lens !
__label__positive__ works as expected , much cheaper choice over canon .
__label__negative__ menu comes up in chinese and the majority of the interface requires activex . not compatible with linux .
__label__positive__ excited about the opportunity to use these on our next trip out to yosemite national park !
__label__negative__ very cheap and not durable as i only used a few times and the tripod snapped in two pieces . good idea but poor production . if it were better quality i 'd rate it higher .
__label__positive__ worked perfectly
__label__positive__ works as advertised . this is a good company which makes quality products . i like to save my 5 star ratings for things that really stand out . this is a really good functional product . maybe it should be five stars . hard to get 5 star excited about something as simple as this , but it is good .
__label__positive__ henry was incredible ! ! i use my new cameras as nanny cams and i can now go to work feeling very comforted that i can still check on my little ones . thank you henry for your wonderful technical support
__label__positive__ an exceptional general use and portrait lens with very close focus ability. < br / > < br / > that may seem like a bit of a letdown statement for a macro lens . do n't get me wrong , i actually love this lens . but well , sadly , this lens is a bit of a letdown for a macro lens . meaning that for 1:1 true macro reproduction it is a poor lens simply because you have to get too close to the subject for 1:1 reproduction . this makes shadows almost a certainty unless using a ring light and with live subjects it is simply too close for their comfort , be it insects , animals and even people ( i.e . eyes ) . < br / > < br / > aside from the 1:1 letdown , it is a superb lens . it 's pretty fast ( f2.8 at infinity focus , f3.2 at 1 foot , f3.5 at 7 inches , f4.2 at minimum focus 1:1 ) for most circumstances and has a very pleasing bokeh and therefore makes for a very nice portrait lens. < br / > < br / > the obvious comparison here is this lens vs. the 35mm f1.8g . 5mm focal length difference is n't really material so i 'll dismiss it for the sake of this discussion and treat them as the same length . the obvious differences are maximum aperture and minimum focus distance . for me personally , i do n't shoot the 35mm f1.8g wide open as it 's a bit soft . i stop it down to f2.2 or f2.5 as the widest aperture unless i 'm in a very dark situation . this pretty much limits the aperture difference between these 2 lenses to less than a stop to 1 full stop for nearly all of my shooting . as i shoot it on a d3300 or d5300 , the iso difference is pretty much negligible and is not a concern for me . this lens is definitely sharper than the 35mm and i like the bokeh better . it 's smoother and more creamy . for portraiture , i will pick this lens everytime over the 35mm , though in all honesty , if i 'm planning a strictly portrait shoot , i 'd use a different lens . it 's a little bigger and a little heavier than the 35mm but not enough to grumble about , i 'm just stating a fact. < br / > < br / > the real advantage of this 40mm is , obviously , the close focus ability . i 'm careful not to say macro as true 1:1 is rather impractical . thing is , i often find myself needing to get closer to my subject than my 35mm will allow . just 1 or 2 inches makes a world of difference at these distances . this lens gives me that freedom to just move right up to my subject and not worry about having to back up . and , boy is it sharp and very pleasing. < br / > < br / > i photograph my indoor cats a lot , to give you an idea of my main use for this lens . the black and white i 've attached is of my cat this morning handheld at 1/60 , f2.8 iso 125 . it has been edited in lr6 but only for black & white conversion , yellow and orange adjustment . no lens correction , clarity , vibrance , saturation , sharpening or noise reduction have been applied. < br / > < br / > unless you need f1.8 speed , i ca n't really imagine anyone being disappointed with this lens . well , manual focusing is really plasticky and sticky , unfortunately . aside from that , i love it . the only reason i 'm not giving it an emphatic 5 stars is that it is in fact a macro lens and in that specific purpose , it 's lacking.s ability . i 'm careful not to say macro as true 1:1 is rather impractical . thing is , i often find myself needing to get closer to my subject than my 35mm will allow . just 1 or 2 inches makes a world of difference at these distances . this lens gives me that freedom to just move right up to my subject and not worry about having to back up . and , boy is it sharp and very pleasing. < br / > < br / > i photograph my indoor cats a lot , to give you an idea of my main use for this lens . the black and white i 've attached is of my cat this morning handheld at 1/60 , f2.8 iso 125 . it has been edited in lr6 but only for black & white conversion , yellow and orange adjustment . no lens correction , clarity , vibrance , saturation , sharpening or noise reduction have been applied. < br / > < br / > unless you need f1.8 speed , i ca n't really imagine anyone being disappointed with this lens . well , manual focusing is really plasticky and sticky , unfortunately . aside from that , i love it . the only reason i 'm not giving it an emphatic 5 stars is that it is in fact a macro lens and in that specific purpose , it 's lacking .
__label__positive__ very happy with my new battery and the seller !
__label__negative__ nothing works , everything in chinese . a totally worthless piece of trash .
__label__positive__ i love the way it look and small enough to carry around
__label__positive__ saved up and bought this for my birthday ! love it but still have so much to learn !
__label__positive__ sony recommended website product for a6000 . fits and protects hot shoe .
__label__positive__ mainly bought this to protect my expensive lenses from damage during day-to-day use , and in that sense they 're saved me more than once .
__label__positive__ perfect fit for camera and lens hood ... additional space for accessories
__label__positive__ this drone is easy and fun to fly . i give it 4 stars because dji did n't put all the best features into the latest software . features that the phantom 2 already had . for example , it will not fly waypoints like it predecessor or current competitors . the video quality of the phantom 3 is amazing and for that it is worth the purchase .
__label__positive__ love it . the ball joint is my favorite feature . love the construction , feels well built but super light-weight. < br / > < br / > quickmount is a bit tough to get on and off .
__label__positive__ exactly as advertised , purfect fit .
__label__neutral__ it fits the computer well and is exactly as presented but within the first week the strap broke , very disappointing
__label__positive__ given as a birthday gift
__label__positive__ very nice portable instruction booklet that be placed into camera bag
__label__positive__ very good camera added this one to a dvr and system that was professionally installed this cameras picture is just as good .
__label__positive__ works fantastic ! ! !
__label__negative__ i returned this after a few days - difficult to use , does n't work in low light , and recording time is extremely limited .
__label__positive__ i was very happy with my purchase . had a trip coming up when i ordered it , and i came in very handy , having extra charger and batteries .
__label__positive__ great for my d80
__label__positive__ great battery arrived on time .
__label__positive__ it 's ok for the money . $ 16 . you can fit your gopro but it 's designed for the older gopro cases and not the newer 3+ and up . keep the foam cutouts because you will need them to fill in spaces to secure your camera and stuff . it 's made pretty good there 's nothing that appears cheap to where it will fall apart in a couple of weeks . i 'll update with a longterm review if there are any issues . but so far yeah i would say it 's worth the money if you are looking for something cheap to carry your camera stuff . keep in mind there are other cases exactly like this one but priced way higher .
__label__positive__ very good camera . solid build and very functionally . lens and photo quality it 's amazing for such a small camera . very accurate and fast autofocus and shutter . flash is poor as all in-cameras flashes are , but it could be handy . wifi works great . i will add a hot shoe and a viewfinder and it would be perfect . it still one of the best quality/price camera i have ever had. < br / > i used to be a professional sport photographer .
__label__positive__ so much fun to share these pictures w/ friends and family !
__label__positive__ sensitive as it should be
__label__positive__ selfie stick works great , and it secures my phone nicely . very pleased with their customer service also .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ fine
__label__positive__ these are great for saving your props and great for promoting safety ! !
__label__positive__ this is an amazing lens . i took it out for a test drive and it blew my mind in reach , clarity and contrast .
__label__positive__ works great . even fits over my life jacket when i used it on the water
__label__positive__ kenneth , was very patient and courteous . he helped me with a blocking problem and was able to help reconnect my second camera . i 've enjoyed using my foscam camera so much that i purchased one for my daughter to have as a baby monitor . she is thrilled . it is so convenient and useful . it is a great product . thanks , carolyn
__label__negative__ it seemed like it took forever to get it . when i finally recieved it i charged it up and it worked for about 20 minutes and then it stopped working . i tried recharging it and it would not charge . i am very disapointed because i had vacation movies in my camera and i ca n't even see them now .
__label__negative__ [ [ videoid:2159cfd3aadee35e75e247a07f4f2ce4 ] ] a quick demonstration of the pros and cons of the fastfire camera strap .
__label__positive__ product is excellent and fast shipping ! ! ! thanks
__label__positive__ samll and compact . good buy
__label__positive__ this is exactly what i was looking for ! i bought these for my daughter and new son-in-law to take on their honeymoon . i tried it out on some of my scuba gear and the camera floaties are perfect for cameras and back up dive lights .
__label__positive__ great home security system in a well designed product . easy set up and great ui in the app . it is a little sensitive , but im confident that will be adjusted in time .
__label__positive__ delivered as promised , great deal to replace a lost one . thank you !
__label__positive__ protective & perfect fit for my gopro silver 4
__label__negative__ it doesnt work for my les . was a different size . it´s the second time that happenned to me .
__label__positive__ got as birthday gift for wife , and she loves it. < br / > pictures are beautiful and it brings back the nostalgia of the insta pic camera .
__label__positive__ i purchased this elsewhere , but its the same unit . the setup was not complicated and it is working great . the hardest thing is running the cables to the cameras . i purchased some 150 ' extensions for 2 of the runs and there is not degradation in the picture . i had to run some of the cables on the roof , so we 'll see how they survive the texas heat . the cameras are good quality and easy to install . they tilt and move simple enough . the recorder has a good interface and large icons for moving around . there are several settings you can change , and i have n't played with most of them . i am looking forward to setting up the email notifications . the remote viewing setup via the ipolis was simple also . my wife and i can view the cameras on our iphones or the web on a computer if we want . all in all a very nice system so far with no issues .
__label__negative__ drop cam was perfect before nest changed everything .
__label__positive__ this is a fun thing to have , but it is very hard to find anywhere to buy the film .
__label__positive__ excellent service and product
__label__positive__ i love this product and have been using it for my short video productions and it does a pretty good ob for the price ! !
__label__positive__ i love it ! thank you !
__label__neutral__ 0ut of range is n't as far as i thought it would be .
__label__positive__ i like using this filter to prevent my lens from scratching .
__label__positive__ works
__label__positive__ everything works great . small size and easy to operate .
__label__positive__ purchased mainly for the protective filter . pleased with the fit and quality and recommend the seller !
__label__positive__ prompt shipping , works properly - grip holes smaller than expected , i did n't think to investigate before purchase .
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid:97039116c14a9fb099e74cc662cc0a88 ] ] this is my second unit , the first one was return because it would not charge and or power up my gopro , with or without the battery installed , i tried a different cable and voila ! it worked ! so the new one came with a cable that worked just fine . i 'm very happy with it. < br / > < br / > and no , i was not given a sample to review , this is just a review of a genuinely good product in my opinion that does exactly what it advertises and does it well . i even tried charging my iphone 6 and it worked. < br / > < br / > btw , it also charges the go pro 's battery , as you can see from my video
__label__positive__ works great ! very happy with charger .
__label__positive__ i am totally surprised at how sharp this cheap lens actually is . it is a delightful piece of glass . clear and extremely sharp under all kinds of lighting conditions . it 's weight is a no concern issue if you are logging backpacks and other gear . it 's a great inexpensive , light weight and sharp lens that it does n't disappoint .
__label__positive__ i am an aspiring professional photography and i spoke with a person from customer service on nikon 's website to help me find a camera that fit my needs and my style of photography . they helped me out a lot and helped me make the right choice . this camera is fantastic ! it has a wide range of capabilities for various photography styles . it also has some photo editing tools built right in . due to me not being a pro , i feel there is a lot i ca n't say at this point . it was a great buy and i am very happy . the bag is great also , have n't checked out the dvd just yet . this camera is easy to use and understand . i recommend it for other aspiring photographers .
__label__positive__ exactly what i needed , they worked perfectly !
__label__positive__ could n't be happier with this purchase i made , i 'm ready to start my business and this is the start to it . i would highly recommend this item to everyone !
__label__positive__ so far i 'm very pleased with my purchase of these lp-e6 2600 mah batteries . i used two of them in my canon 5d mark iii battery grip and they 've lasted through three assignments already . i was skeptical at first because i could n't figure out how these batteries could sell for such a low price and canon charges $ 60.00 for theirs on amazon.com. < br / > < br / > i 'm not completely sold yet but i 'm convinced that i 've gotten my money 's worth thus far . i 'll keep you posted .
__label__positive__ this system is great and works as advertised . over 90 % of all alarm calls are false alarms , so i like the self monitoring feature ( but you can have it monitored ) . another added benefit is the ability to use any sim card/phone provider that you want . we have poor service at our home with verizon and t-mobile , so the simplisafe system would not work at our house . instead we went with an h20 sim card ( uses at & t ) and everything works great .
__label__neutral__ it arrived safely . the camera is what i hoped it would be & more ... but the accessories were somewhat generic . the external flash does n't fit the camera at all . i had to purchase a larger bag to fit the camera and the lenses . overall i 'm happy with my purchase but i 'll have to buy other things to make it complete !
__label__positive__ i was looking for the exact replacement for my existing frame . it 's a well made sd card-based frame and i did n't want anything else .
__label__positive__ i mounted this baby at our front door and we love it . my wife had wanted a camera for years and now we have one . the price is great and it has all of the functionality we need . it 's pretty amazing really . if it lasts i would say there are no drawbacks for us . we are watching you ! it is also an additional deterrent for would-be burglars .
__label__positive__ somewhat hard to remove from camera once attached .
__label__positive__ this sony battery charger arrived quickly and is working perfectly .
__label__positive__ no surprises - items as advertised - all work well
__label__positive__ nice camera , as described , meets expectations , ,nice for underwater and outdoors
__label__positive__ we bought this for my husband for his job as a home inspector . it works beautifully . the only problem we have is that the battery is charged in the camera . we bought an inexpensive charger that plugs in so we can keep 2 or 3 charged batteries in the case at all times . so far the pictures are very good , even those in the low light of an attic or under the crawl space . the video feature is handy . we have n't used the wifi yet . we have n't used it underwater .
__label__positive__ just got it today & very pleased . wanted a camera with a good zoom without paying a bundle & this really fit the bill . it came sooner than i thought , ordered it on a holiday weekend & received it on tuesday , great service ( photo4less ) . took this picture through a window , sitting in a chair from across the room !
__label__positive__ right angle viewer works on canon reflex camera..dont have to bend your head so much .
__label__negative__ this does not fit the intax mini 90 as advertised . so disappointed as i wanted a case for my camera . i could n't even squeeze it in . return was easy enough though .
__label__negative__ my film pictures came out bad super bad quality
__label__positive__ amazing product ! !
__label__positive__ great kit ! got this for my nephew who is a sponsored for long boarding . gives him lots of options to get great footage . very well made . was impressed with the quality of the case . we might need to buy another so we can get some good skiing footage . i recieved this product at a discount for my honest review . definatly get one , a must have !
__label__positive__ delivered on time and works great !
__label__positive__ it is working. < br / > very good quality product , but there is not enough space for a cell phone .
__label__positive__ works like a charm . when on vacation , i keep an extra battery in my bag and has come in handy .
__label__positive__ this compact little beast of burden of a camera is a real surprise . my dslr camera fogs up in the beach front humidity , but the water proof case for this camera keeps it fog free . a simple swipe of the case over the lens clears up the path for photography even when we 're in the ocean . a wrist strap keeps the camera secure and i can snap pictures of the family while we 're body surfing in the waves . the tiny screen is too small to be seen well in the bright light outside , but the camera has a 3 snap burst mode that is the photographer 's equivalent of spray and pray for the shot . there are some drawbacks to this little camera : there is no zoom function . this means you must be really close to people to get the shots . the camera is fairly low resolution , so it 's not really possible to crop the photos to tighten up the shot more than a little bit . there is no flash unit , but it does have the ability to capture photos in surprisingly low levels of light . pluses include the very quick lens speed in bright light that catches very fast actions like clumps of sand flung into air by a toddler and individual splashes of water drops . in short , i 'm having a really blast with the anart .
__label__positive__ camera lens was mess up . canon replace this camera with a other refur camera !
__label__negative__ horrible . upon attempting to remove it from my flash trigger , the end of the cord snipped off . ultra delicate junk .
__label__positive__ perfect ! !
__label__positive__ please read this first , then i will review the product . i ordered this from amazon ( amazon llc seller ) . new body , full retail price of $ 1,200. < br / > < br / > the first product i received was slightly used . there was no warranty card and it already had 50 pictures taken on it . i called them and they sent me a replacement . the new camera was beaten up and had 2,500 pictures already taken on it. < br / > < br / > if you want to buy this camera , buy it at a retail store , in person , and check to make sure it 's brand new in the store before purchasing it. < br / > < br / > so , onto the camera itself . i will break this down into pros and cons : < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > -large buffer , significantly better than d7100 < br / > -fairly fast framerate < br / > -superb image quality ; low iso quality is equivalent to some high quality fx cameras ( e.g. , d750 ) < br / > -nice build and ergonomics < br / > -plenty of customization options and buttons < br / > -amazing focus systems < br / > -best dx camera out there , imo < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > -not a huge upgrade from d7100 , except for buffer < br / > -not great low-light performance , though not bad ( just nowhere near as great as say , the d610 or d750 ) ; only slightly better than d5100 < br / > < br / > if you 're considering upgrading to this or d7100 , i recommend this if buffer matters to you at all . while overall it 's only a slight upgrade , the focus system , buffer , and image quality can make a world of difference , especially if you shoot wildlife , sports or macro .
__label__positive__ works as it should and i have not had any problems with these . currently running 5 of them with ip cameras .
__label__positive__ thanks
__label__positive__ product came as described but took a little while to get here ( us ) . i suggest local if you need it quicker .
__label__positive__ great trail camera . very sensitive capturing much more than expected .
__label__negative__ this product is so bad , i really do not recommend you buy this , first the bulbs with which the lamp biene not work and when replacing the lamp inside smoke came out way too literally is melting by the heat , used materiale are not the right high temperature so that the lamp looks like a chimney is really disastrous not to mention the stream of light emitted , you have no spot light control glass does nothing at all , i repeat not buy this product .
__label__positive__ it worked fine until i did the software upgrade and now there are some issues of getting the controller to start is not as straight forward as it was when i first got it . there does n't seem to be a fix for it yet , at least not on their site . the unit itself and the camera are excellent . their software support and instructions really suck .
__label__positive__ good clairity for birding . not disapoined .
__label__positive__ the case is large enough for the camera and some accessories
__label__positive__ admitible
__label__neutral__ great battery with super long running time . love that aspect , but the clip that keeps it in the gopro broke the first week i had it . it still stays in the camera if the camera is in a case though . if the clip had n't broke , this would be a 5 star battery .
__label__positive__ good for what it is designed to do . works really well as a slave . refresh time is a little slower than i would want it to be but for 35 buks i should not be picky !
__label__positive__ as an enthusiastic user of the dropcampro i was mad paranoid about all the poor reviews that i read about the new iteration of nest cam , so much so that i bought a used dropcampro at the same time as a new nest cam so i would have a backup . i 'm pleased to say that thus far the nest cam is performing at the same level as the dropcampro and i 'm quite pleased . more to come as our usage increases. < br / > update : performing well in concert with the two existing dropcam pro units both day and night . no problems thus far , with the exception of the occasional disconnect from wifi which could be a comcast issue as well . will likely purchase a second nest cam to round out the house surveillance bubble with 4 cameras . love the wide field of view .
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ video recording quality is not that great but takes great shots .
__label__positive__ freaking love it ... ..
__label__positive__ they were exactely what i wanted .
__label__positive__ i am delighted with my purchase . thanks for having them in your marketplace .
__label__positive__ perfect fit .
__label__positive__ perfect for our slr , very sleek and compact to do day trips with . rain fly is clutch . there is no room for any other gear you want to carry , except for very small essential accessories like a battery , a lens cap , or things equally flat and small .
__label__negative__ looks nothing like the picture on the box.just clear through cheap plastic . cant get the film roller to turn.acts like it is locked into position . then what could you expect for 10.00 ? hopefully i can return it .
__label__positive__ very nice
__label__neutral__ a little different hopefully i can get it to work right as i live in the middle of no where so i need a seeing eye when i am not home .
__label__negative__ not user friendly
__label__positive__ batteries can in good time . they work perfectly , and were a steal at the price . i will definitely order from this person again .
__label__positive__ works well as a basic , every day lens and fits my close up lens set for use in flower photography . nice addition to my camera bag .
__label__positive__ works great . time will tell how durable it is .
__label__positive__ very practical works very good . i like it .
__label__negative__ ok so the glass on this lens is pretty good . the 1.8 aperture allows tons of light in for indoor photos. < br / > < br / > the bad ! the focus ring felt like it had sand or something grinding in it . i could not even get it to return to infinity after focusing on objects of differing distances . and the aperture ring is quite stiff as well. < br / > < br / > given the large amounts of positive reviews i may have just gotten a bad one . but rather than try my luck i returned mine and will be spending the extra money for canon glass .
__label__positive__ just what i needed . works great .
__label__negative__ i bought 3 of these and threw them all away . the smell of the rubber was so intense that i assume they must be carcinogenic . i did n't want them around with young kids in the house . buy giotto one instead , it does n't stink .
__label__positive__ just as described , ,thanks
__label__positive__ i love the products ! ! !
__label__positive__ perfect
__label__positive__ set up was a breeze . the quality of the video is good . every once in a while the camera loses connectivity but it always fixes itself . the motion zones work fairly well . i would like a little more control to be able to eliminate pets as a source of motion , but it works well on the computer , ipad , and iphone .
__label__positive__ i really love these accessories ! it comes with the case , selfie mirror , 4 color changing lenses , several different picture frames , stickers to go on the photos , stickers to go on the camera , and a mini photo album . the case is awesome and fits the camera perfectly . however , if you have the selfie mirror attachment on the camera you ca n't really close the case . all of the items have really made using this camera a lot of fun ! the package arrived on time and was not bent or damaged .
__label__positive__ i love this . i purchased this to go along with my fotga main system rail and should rest . the handles can be position so that you 're able to attain a very natural but elbows-in posture helping to stabilize your footage . the only things i would mention is that the screws are plastic and a bit hard to tighten enough to get a real hold on the handles ( they will loosen a little over time requiring retightening . overall it 's a great built and it 's nice and light .
__label__positive__ great backup batteries !
__label__negative__ bought it for a brag book for one evening . binding came completely off . very cheaply made. < br / > < br / > wo n't recommend this unless you buy super glue too .
__label__negative__ 1 . super expensive. < br / > 2 . wrong advertising on dim light < br / > 3 . colors is bad < br / > 4 . designed for iphone4 case , not fit other phone. < br / > 5 . too strong light ... bad bad bad . created lot of highlights. < br / > < br / > i keep it , becuase i only spend $ 15 for new one when it get promoted , if you are pay for more than $ 15 , return it , get different brand .
__label__neutral__ the app for the phone sucks i have htc m8 i can download the videos and pictures but i when i watch the videos no sound
__label__negative__ plastic . cheap . threw it away .
__label__positive__ hardly used but this is the best tripod i can say , since so many of my friends barrowed it several times .
__label__positive__ finally got these installed . for the most part easy to set up . picture is good quality . clear . very good purchase . one of the best features is the ability to install app on phone and you can see your home from anywhere !
__label__positive__ works very well
__label__neutral__ good
__label__positive__ this thing is a beast for the price . have done 160mph on my motorcycle with it . still going strong even after my dog chewed on it . i even put in on the outside of my car with suction cup mount . those people complaining about no sound , try playing with vlc media player and see if it works . i do not get sound with window media player but get sound with vlc .
__label__positive__ excellent value . i have a gopro but this excellent value allows me to place a camera in more dangerous locations with less concern . mask works great also .
__label__positive__ its wonderful ! delivery perfect ! ! ! ! im happy ! thank so mach ! !
__label__positive__ good price and fast delivery . a+ works like a charm on all our phones , tablets and best of all the screens in our trucks .
__label__positive__ do n't expect gopro item but price benefit ratio , this is good . i do n't do pro video just average video of everyday stuff , this fit the bill nicely . seller responds to questions is great
__label__positive__ everything was awesome the kit included everything and the camera seems to work perfectly love the 20 x zoom
__label__positive__ very nice quality , replaces a cheaper imitation i bought in a bundled kit . feels very secure and sturdy . comes with a bubble level .
__label__neutral__ it broke in the first week , so it takes a lot longer to set up the shots , but it is light and cheap and holds the camera still .
__label__positive__ excellent product . i have no problems with it . it works as expected .
__label__positive__ nice kit and nicer price ! everything fits perfctly with my gopro . delivered on time . use the gopro screw insted of the one provided , it get oxid after first use .
__label__positive__ good product
__label__positive__ just one word ... ... .awesome !
__label__positive__ looks as authentic as my real dome cams .
__label__positive__ roy < br / > 2nd call did the job .as far as camera , for the money , excellent and great picture and wireless , perfect
__label__positive__ a good system for the price . easy to install and the video quality is very good both day and night . the dvr remote and one cable did n't work , and the dvr makes a strange whistling noise , but overall i 'm happy . i planned on using 6 cameras but ended up using all 8 . setup is easy and i am impressed with the mobile app . good luck with support from zosi , as nobody speaks good english . if something does n't work you will have to pay to replace it because they act like they do n't understand you . i had to get all of the instructions from youtube and just common sense .
__label__positive__ these binoculars are long as hell , when you look at something , you are already half way there . really need a tripod with these binoculars .
__label__positive__ a+ would order from here again !
__label__positive__ good product , overpriced for what it is .
__label__positive__ excellent price .
__label__negative__ poor qaulity
__label__positive__ one of the best nikon cameras i 've ever owned and i had many . paired with good glass the results are excellent . i would buy it again , as a matter of fact i did , i have two .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ awesome for the money
__label__positive__ good quality
__label__positive__ works well . good value for the money . yes , you can find fancier cases , but this was very functional .
__label__positive__ well check my comment on the sigma contemporary. < br / > i tested both of the lens , and despite hoping the sigma is better , i am keeping the tamron , it just works .
__label__positive__ in the day its a wide clear color view ... at night its clear black and white in the pitch dark : )
__label__negative__ i bought this with high hopes of making my as100 mount as nice as my gopro . unfortunately , as with most helmets when mounted in a spot that will not prohibit view obstruction ( they are kinda round ya know ) , i did not have enough adjustment to make the video level/horizontal . i was off 5 degrees from horizontal which looks pretty bad . for $ 30 in accessories you can make a much better mount . check out my video on it https : //youtu.be/snlcp-jjmrm or https : //youtu.be/osrlet68r1e
__label__positive__ very happy with my drone
__label__positive__ great ! ! exactly what i was looking at good price .
__label__positive__ perfect fit for my a66 ; eye viewfinder activation works fine . 1/3 the cost of a sony replacement .
__label__positive__ it works like it 's advertised , i wish it was a bit more thicker .
__label__negative__ - the chain can not go into the hole at the top of the device because it 's too-big < br / > < br / > - each time i would power-it up , it would flash a few times and go off in a just a couple seconds < br / > < br / > - it 's not the worst-looking , but it 's more of a 'goth ' type cross and -- on me -- it would just look too-unusual/out of place ; it 's pretty-thick < br / > < br / > - it has trouble getting recognized by the computer ; when it is , you can not look at any files on it and it is unable to be reformatted < br / > < br / > - while charging ( apparently ) , it gets really hot < br / > < br / > - there 's a popular , light '808 car keys ' camcorder that i saw some videos of ; it was of interest that a person spoke of having a model with built-in memory that would just fail -- and to him , it was a memory issue ; after taking a chance with one that took a memory-card , it was fine -- - and i suspect that there 's such a problem with this ; however , there is no version that takes a memory card < br / > < br / > - i got a refund , fortunately ; do n't waste your time trying to get one that works ; i ca n't say that all of these will be a waste , but i 'm not taking a chance with another
__label__positive__ take your photography to the next level ! the dome light sphere is head and shoulders above the competition and not because gary fong said so , but by experience . not a bad investment at all !
__label__positive__ i love this , i can now control my bedroom a/c and have it nice and cool by the time i get home . i tried a different belkin plug but it had issues for some reason showing up in the app , so i like this a lot more .
__label__positive__ works just like the oem specs .
__label__positive__ it works but do not expect great stability or performance . it 's lightweight , easy to cover although there is no carrying case with it .
__label__positive__ great price , great easy to use camera ! !
__label__positive__ meets my standard for the cost . my son enjoyed a week of flying , but then the drone did as all before it ... .. took a dive .
__label__positive__ have n't really used them yet , tested them they all work , were shipped on time , so far i think they will work great .
__label__positive__ i was able to use this device to transform an older wireless alarm system from a landline to cellular . previously , it used old style telephone lines , then later a voip phone ( ooma ) over my internet cable . the obvious weakness is that if the line or cable to my house was cut , it can no longer call the monitoring station . the tg-1 express fixed that. < br / > however - the instructions are not user friendly for older alarm systems and/or diy amateur installers ( i had both of those situations ) . for example : it can be powered by two means : 1 ) the aux power position on your alarm system ( mine does n't have one ) or 2 ) an ac to dc adapter . i was able to use a 12v 500ma & # 34 ; wall wart & # 34 ; ( general name for those small plug-in adapters ) . but determining the polarity and power output needed by the tg-1 was difficult . i had to go out and buy a multi-meter to make sure i did n't fry the tg-1 when powering it up . it would have been simple enough for them to have recommended several models of compatible dc adapters . or at least specify not only the voltage ( which they did ) but also the amperage ( which they did n't ) . i had to search all over and make an educated guess. < br / > also - if the tg-1 becomes unpowered , it can not call out . it has no battery backup of its own ( they do tell you this ) . what they do n't tell you is how to remedy that . if you use the & # 34 ; aux power & # 34 ; setting of your alarm box , you must make sure not only of its polarity , voltage and amps , but also if it is powered by your system 's internal battery backup during a power failure at your house/business . to make sure the dc adapter connected to the tg-1 still works if i lose power , i bought a battery ups backup . it took quite a lot of looking on the internet to figure out what kind i needed. < br / > finally - as an amateur diy guy , i was only able to do this with advice from my alarm monitoring company ( which i paid $ 40 for - well worth it too ) . i also had to call a backup battery manufacturer to make sure theirbox would work and for how long ( at least 10 hours , which is plenty ) . that at least was free . all of this info could have been supplied in their manuals . unfortunately , they 're written for the professional installer , not the amateur. < br / > still , i avoided replacing my alarm central or any of its many sensors , saving about $ 1000 . now my connection is cellular , not land line as before . yes , my alarm monitoring company charges more , but i think it 's worth it ( went from $ 9 per month to $ 22 ) . there probably is a way to make the tg-1 express a backup to a landline , but i do n't know how to do that . i still think you get charged the higher rate anyway . imo cellular alone is better than landline alone . many of the newer alarm systems are cellular alone , so somebody else agrees . hopefully , they know more than this amateur !
__label__positive__ works great on my bike but i wish there was some sort of shock-absorbing mechanism on it . it gets a bit shaky offered .
__label__positive__ great tripod , light , small and very stable for size and weight . would buy again if required .
__label__neutral__ it served it purpose ...
__label__positive__ arrived quickly and work fine !
__label__negative__ so frustrated with nest ! customer support is horrible ! ! ! when they migrated drop cam to nest , the completely screwed up the account migration . did n't process auto charge , then threatened to delete account . then admitted it was their fault four times and said account was corrected . now they just deleted all our video history , saying our subscription was expired when they just took the auto payment ! ! ! ! fed up ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ this review is for the t5i . i have n't had a chance to play with this camera as much as i 'd like at the time of writing this , but this is my initial opinions . first , this camera was a surprise from my husband . i am a photographer and had been using an old olympus e-420 for the last 3 years . so getting this uber upgrade was like christmas3 months early ! this camera is great . i was neither a canon or nikon person myself , coming off an olympus , i was completely unbiased in that debate . however , the little dabbling i have done with this camera has been amazing , and i can see becoming a canon fan . whether you are more tech savvy , or totally tech illiterate , this camera has proven to be very user friendly . personally , i 'm the type of person who wants to play and get acquainted with a new toy like this through hands on learning , so i just took it out of the box , put the battery in , an sd card in , the lens on , and played around with the menu and settings for awhile . sure , i will read the ... read more
__label__positive__ it 's a battery . it works fine .
__label__positive__ works well for the price and arrived fairly quick . so yeay : d
__label__positive__ works and looks like a brand new camcorder . battery life is a bit short but since it 's a used battery it will need to be replaced but they 're not expensive . tons of great features on this camera and the video quality is amazing . no scratches or marks on camera , lens or video screen . fast shipping too ( had it in 3 days ) which is very important to me . thumbs up to this seller ! !
__label__positive__ this product is awesome ! it looks 100 % real and also came with a sticker to let people know you have a camera on the premises . i 'm absolutely thrilled with the product ! installation was as easy as drilling in three screws and pointing the camera . great price my only complaint is it took about two weeks to receive it but it shipped from china and i received it two weeks earlier than the estimated arrival date : ) if you 're looking for a dummy security camera to protect yourself this is what you want !
__label__positive__ the best battery charger for the money and bought this with my own money ! !
__label__positive__ just what i needed to replace my old manfrotto heavy tri pod
__label__neutral__ smaller then expected but not to bad wish i got a bigger once ... not bad for the price !
__label__positive__ excellent product quality
__label__positive__ awesome light , great illumination , it 's plastic but it 's not cheap plastic like others said , i use it for chroma screen and i 'm really happy with the results , extra recommended .
__label__negative__ does not work . everything comes out in red . dived with it several times in hawaii and had the same disappointing effect .
__label__positive__ the camera works great ! all the accessories were there as advertised . we have enjoyed using the camera and have gotten a lot of great pictures already !
__label__positive__ tough and easy to use . a great tripod
__label__positive__ it works
__label__positive__ system works great . single cable per camera makes installation fairly simple . the menus of the system itself can be difficult at first , but with some playing around you will figure it out . image quality both day and night are good . i wish there was a way to disable the ifrared on the cameras , so i could just use a remote ir light . the ir on the cameras lure insects and will cause the motion detection to be set and start recording , but this can be minimized with certain settings adjustments .
__label__positive__ the pina zangaro presentation book is absolutely beautiful . i 'm a recent graduate from a graphic design program and i was originally skeptical at the notion of spending so much money on what appeared to be a glorified binder . however , when it arrived and i put everything together , my portfolio looked outstanding . there is something about printed media that a computer screen simply ca n't hold a candle to . i 've gotten several compliments regarding the professionalism during my job interviews from prospective employers.the majority of my class went down the pina zangaro route , so i have seen most of the various models they offer , and i have to say , they all look fantastic .
__label__positive__ i bought this camera for my trip to europe . i absolutely love it ! very easy to use , lightweight and takes great photos ! it came with everything you could possibly need . a great value . would definitely recommend .
__label__positive__ looks great ! but the part that screws on does n't quite fit ... it 's a little too small on the bottom which makes the top part stick straight out . the top half kind of covers it ... other than the fit , it works pretty well , so i 'm pretty happy with it so far .
__label__negative__ 40 % of the pictures show up completely blurry . unimpressed .
__label__positive__ i wanted a tripod that would fit in a backpack , and this fits that criteria . i attach an 8-lb heilman pastel box to the tripod , so the ball head is not sturdy enough for that . i swapped out the head for a manfrotto pan head that i have , and that works well enough . i also hang a bag from the center post for extra stability .
__label__positive__ found these very informational
__label__positive__ i 'm giving 4 out of 5 only because the quick release plate is somewhat light , although it should be perfectly adequate for most cameras . also , there was no instructions for how to order another plate , which many users would probably want to do . the tripod is well made and sturdy , and can support almost any camera .
__label__positive__ it fit my little sony camera well .
__label__positive__ this was perfect . met my expectations and was a great price !
__label__positive__ a must have for time lapse shooting and astrophotography ...
__label__positive__ it works with my nikon d40 perfect . i 'm new to all this so all i can say is the pics look good to me .
__label__positive__ super stuff .
__label__positive__ arrived fast easy to install
__label__positive__ it was just what i was looking for on a budget price . it swivels to several increments allowing you to bounce the flash for a variety of effects . it seems to be well made too . i would recommend this to a friend .
__label__positive__ this camera , thus far is superior to the dlink product which costs more . they could use a bit of work on the directions but once i got what they were asking it was a snap .
__label__positive__ works great - have had this driveway bell for 15+ years and recently upgraded to the newer model
__label__negative__ amazon was quick as usual , but just as kidscritcaredoc , i received my backup inspire 1 dual controller ( shipped/sold by amazon ) yesterday with a completely dead battery . it too was a & # 34 ; b & # 34 ; instead of the most current & # 34 ; d & # 34 ; which is the only revision i was looking for . will be returning or exchanging one way or another for a & # 34 ; d & # 34 ; model .
__label__neutral__ would have liked the cases to be a bit more sturdy but worked as expected .
__label__positive__ i 've had this almost a month now and it 's been working great . my husband set up the alerts and has the app on his iphone . works well as we use it to keep an eye on our skittish dog . i have a windows phone , so sadly there 's no app for me : ( but i can log on to the website using the desktop version instead of the mobile version of my phone ( just change it in the settings and hit refresh once you 're at the webpage on your phone ) and it works well enough that i can see the room and keep an eye on the dog . so , with that being said we 're very happy with the purchase . and it saved us from having a wrecked apartment on the 4th of july !
__label__positive__ great quality , super cute and really comfortable to carry around . the divider in the middle can be laid down so you can use it for other things too , i 've used this bag to carry around my dslr lenses before as well . it 's also very sturdy .
__label__negative__ really dinky size box , and the edges do n't come together cleanly . takes a lot of fiddling . you ca n't photograph anything but the smallest items in it . we tried using the lamps without the box , but they 're too unbalanced as a light source and make stripes and odd colors on whatever the item is . we 're really sorry that we bought it -- a waste of money .
__label__positive__ what a great product ! ! ! no longer do i have to ask strangers to take pictures for me ! i attached my android phone , works like a charm.it also worked with my girlfriend 's i phone.no hassle , and it 's so convient to use .
__label__positive__ fits my camera like a glove ! easy to carry and excellent quality .
__label__negative__ after a few days it stopped working
__label__negative__ i purchased this flash 2 months ago , and the mount just fell apart . i normally take off the flash and put it in the case it comes with to keep it protected . i have used the flash an average of 4 times per week over the last 2 months , but i expected it to last longer than this . i am really disappointed . it was a decent small flash though i can not find a compatible flash extender for this size . i do not recommend this flash .
__label__positive__ it works on iphone 5 . thank you
__label__positive__ excelent
__label__positive__ it seems cheap , but it works just fine . i 'm suing it with my netgear arlo camera . it fits just fine , and easy enough to adjust . my only wish is that they came with self drilling screws . as these come with fairly standard type screws and plastic wall anchors . of which i am sure would work just fine . but , if you need to drill into wood or something that does n't need the anchor , the self drilling screws would be more useful .
__label__positive__ awesome , works like a charm ... ..
__label__positive__ very nice bag , it works perfectly with my zipshot mini . please note it will not fit the larger zipshot tripods .
__label__positive__ delivery was as described and arrived as promised ; packaging was adequate . the quality and condition of the product was as promised. < br / > < br / > i 'm satisfied with this purchase .
__label__positive__ bought it in 2003 . used it for a couple of years and put it away . thought i 'd look at some old tapes and was happy with the quality . dusted it off and using it again . looks and performs like new . such a neat little camera .
__label__positive__ seems to be the perfect fit ! great value for my 6d !
__label__positive__ this camera worked pretty well , seemed user friendly . i was concerned at first because i had n't realized it was a camera separate with a waterproof case - which made me worry about it leaking more than my original sea life camera , which was just a waterproof camera . i took it on 12 dives with no problems . i quickly discovered that the lighting system was n't too impressive , plus it makes for a bulky item to lug around ( even in water ) . it was only useful if we swam through dark tunnels and inside wrecks . therefore , for most dives i only took the camera . i bought a fisheye lens to go on it , but found it works best for closeup photos , so i soon left it off more and more . the lens easily pops on and off , but my worry was dragging it around when it was off . if you use the spotlight frame , there is a place to store the lens . my photos did n't all turn out as great as i 'd hoped , but we dived on a few cloudy/overcast days and there seemed to be a fair amount of particles in the water , preventing me from using the camera 's flash . overall , it was a great camera and i look forward to using it on my next scuba diving trip . i would possibly consider buying an external flash , though .
__label__positive__ the description on the website claims that this wrist strap will work with many different camera brands . unfortunately , it did n't float with my olympus tg 4 camera attached to it . it just went straight to the bottom of the pool . update : saw other people 's comments about weight limitations per strap . i 'll try it with both straps attached next time i 'm using my waterproof camera . changed my rating from one star to four stars as i did n't have a chance to test it with both straps . once i try it and it indeed works , i 'll update my review .
__label__neutral__ the item is not worth the price paid .
__label__positive__ we bought a dash cam for my wife 's car following an erroneous traffic ticket . hers was about $ 10 more and the screen is much smaller . it works fine but this dash cam is great . the pictures are clear and steady and even my wife commented on how visible everything is even at night . thinking of buying another one for the rear of my truck . people just follow way to close here .
__label__positive__ works great with smartthings ... wish it was a little smaller .
__label__positive__ good quality glass with convenient carrying case .
__label__negative__ i experienced quite a but if distortion around the edges with this on .
__label__positive__ super fast postage and a brilliantly priced bit of fun for your phone . i have a htc one m8 and had to use the sticky ring to mount the lenses but you can hardly tell its there . i like both the fisheye and the wide angle but my favourite is the macro ! so much fun to be had with it ! it would be an ideal gift .
__label__positive__ i 'm using the gopro on my motorcycle and it works awesome . i did n't receive the remote with it , but they were quick to fix that when i sent them an email . good product good business !
__label__positive__ first camera i 've owned that was n't on my iphone . totally happy 100 % . phenomenal quality for the price that will make any first time buyer happy .
__label__positive__ i bought this back in 2009 , so it 's not really fair to review it by 2015 standards . it still works and it has always done what it 's supposed to do . the user interface is kludgy ( even by 2009 standards ) , but you do n't have to mess with on screen controls much to use the camera .
__label__positive__ great quality ! works well .
__label__neutral__ i love the idea and beauty of this system ! however my iphone kept twisting around just as i pressed the button . the screws did not steady the iphone nor hold it in place so that it would not move .
__label__positive__ henry was very helpful getting my camera set up , foscam underestimates wait times on the phone but that is it for you . an hour later i can not connect to my camera , it says incorrect username/password
__label__positive__ works very well . could n't use with the ast camera case - did n't fit properly . anoyher reason ast shoud n't besold with mx-1 .
__label__neutral__ just ok
__label__positive__ very good quality item , better than i expected for the price .
__label__negative__ forget this one if you 're trying to use it with a 500 or 600 mm lens on an open car window . the crease is n't large enough to hold the bag in place . i end up having to hold the bag with one hand !
__label__positive__ this is the best kit you can buy for your gopro camera at this price . amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so many parts for your gopro . if you are a gopro user you definitely want to get this . was pleasantly surprised with package , especially at the price . i thought it was going to be cheesy but all mounts are solid and well made ! ! ! ! it came with all parts it said it would . it also fits my gopro hero 4 silver edition . all items work well , the chest harness fits nicely . i would recommend this to anyone who does not want to spend the high price tag on the gopro accessories .
__label__positive__ perfect vision
__label__positive__ this thing is perfect for beginners trying to get in to drone filming ! and for the price !
__label__positive__ works good , already had a accident in mi dirt bike and resist the impact , but keeps working good ! ! !
__label__negative__ ended up keeping since the return shipping would make it a wash . note : there are not 50 leds as claimed in the description- just one blinking red light . meh
__label__negative__ the battery was about a millimeter off from the correct size , so it would only make momentary and unreliable contact with the canon camera 's battery housing , which made it unusable . had to send it back . return was handled promptly , but i would recommend using another retailer for this battery .
__label__positive__ kept my backpack organized
__label__positive__ worked fine
__label__positive__ very fast everything perfect ! thanks ! !
__label__negative__ i bought the camera about 1 year ago . with 6 months of use the monitor battery life started getting bad , when it was wall cable unplugged , lasted only 30/40 minutes . now almost one year of use , the battery swelled , leaving out equipment . it still works , but the battery is out .
__label__positive__ great deal !
__label__positive__ very nice
__label__positive__ the system is great . simple to install and makes you feel safer .
__label__positive__ these work perfectly .
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid : c3f0708ab042d811d3288ed2d46bc6e5 ] ] product name : arkon gopro bike motorcycle handlebar or roll bar strap mount for gopro hero4 hero3+ gopro hero3 gopro hero2 and hero cameras < br / > < br / > short description : this is an awesome accessory for the gopro simply because its ease of use . works like a huge zip tie for your gopro and allows you to place it quick and it is very secure . you do get a lot of strap so it would fit most bars or small size tree branches or motorcycle/bicycle bars etc . the plastics and construction are great like any of the arkon products . they also have the great products so be sure to check their store out i found other things did n't even know existed there. < br / > < br / > visual appearance ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ < br / > intended purpose ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ < br / > cost ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ < br / > quality ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ < br / > < br / > pros & cons : < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > ❤️ easy and simple to use < br / > ❤️ great design for versatility. < br / > ❤️ all the materials are very strong. < br / > cons : < br / > 💔 i do wish it could be turned from side to side , this one only faces forward and makes a little sense for motorcycle but i will not remove any stars because the descriptions does not say that it turns so its all good , just make sure you only need a forward/ or backwards angle and do n't need to turn from left to right . i do believe they have another product that does this so check out the store. < br / > < br / > final thoughts and personal opinion : this is super cool and super easy to use so i definitely recommend it. < br / > < br / > you can watch an hd version of this review in my youtube channel by accessing the link on my profile located here : https : //www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/a3cmeg0r6s3nq7/ref=cm_cr_thx_pdp. < br / > < br / > the seller , in exchange for an honest and unbiased review , supplied me with this product. < br / > what you have read and watched is solely my very honest opinion based on my expertise and experience with this product. < br / > < br / > if this review was helpful please help others find it by clicking yes below < br / > < br / > reviewed by rody arocheg yes below < br / > < br / > reviewed by rody aroche
__label__positive__ great product , options . smart phone app to see , hear , talk to your home . can set it up so it sends you an email with pictures when motion detector is activated . i , and i think , most people will need technical support to help set these up ! brandon helped me through the 1-800 number tech support and was fantastic !
__label__positive__ bag really thin , wo n't last for extended wear or heavy travel . ok for just storage. < br / > tripod does the job , extends easy , very versatile for uneven ground , has a mimi built in level bubble . use caution , thin metal that seems like it can bend and damage easily but mine just stays in one spot. < br / > very light weight so good for travel . folds to about 2 feet so not sure if it 'll fit in a backpack for travel. < br / > purchased for my canon sx40 but has what seems to be a standard screw that can fit just about any camera .
__label__negative__ followed the instructions and it worked for 2 seconds . try to get help from company tech , was told maybe get a call back the next day . received a call back around 2 pm . return product , not worth the trouble for the price .
__label__positive__ i love my new camera ! it finally came in and is exactly how i expected it to be : )
__label__positive__ fits like a glove .
__label__positive__ the best bag for a dslr camera . great quality .
__label__positive__ perfect , exactly what i needed . the cover is cardboard with a thick plastic slip over it . the inside pockets do not stick to photos thank goodness ! !
__label__positive__ great deal ! love the dual charging ability . thanks !
__label__negative__ battery grips provide the advantage of longer shooting time with fewer battery changes and allow easier portrait shooting while providing some balance to the camera . that being said , this grip falls short in that it has an external wire linking the battery compartment to the camera that often gets caught on branches when i 'm out shooting landscapes or wildlife . a bit of gaffers tape helps keep that under control , but it 's poor design , nonetheless . the bigger issue us that i constantly have issues with the camera shutting off because the contacts on the vertical portion of the battery grip do not properly seat into the camera . canon did n't make the grip , so the quality is not quite up to par . it 's lightweight and has the advantage of being able to use aa batteries , but if power ca n't get to the camera from the battery grip due to a problem with getting the grip to mate with the camera contacts properly , then the product is useless . can not recommend .
__label__positive__ solid piece of equipment
__label__positive__ this is a great lens and i 've hesitated from getting the 85mm l for a long time because my results with this inexpensive 85mm lens have been superb . i 've used it under combat conditions - weddings , portraits , events - and it gives me fast and accurate autofocus , great bokeh , and versatility . i 'm sure the 85mm l is the perfect portrait lens , but my clients rave over my results . these are their memories that are being preserved and this lens come through .
__label__positive__ this mount is solid and inspires confidence . any lens wobble on my nex-7 is gone . even a long , heavy tamron lens ( with adapter ) fits solidly . i chose the light-tight version because i wanted to be safe during long night exposures . i can not compare this version to the regular fotodiox mount . suggestion : watch the fotodiox installation video and make sure you have a quality set of screwdrivers . splurge so you do n't strip the screws .
__label__positive__ good quality products . have not had any issues with this product . i 've put them through many obstacles and still holding . there are things included which i have no idea what they are for . a manual would 've been nice ! that 's why 4 stars .
__label__neutral__ i like this case because it holds the camera and the additional equipment securely ; however , i wish i could be slung to the other side . it does rub my shoulder a little more than i 'd like , but i definitely prefer this to the larger traditional camera cases .
__label__negative__ had this one for a week . was unable to fly it the first two days . it would not take off . after googling , found out what the problem was : the blades had been assembled incorrectly . after fixing that , it was time to make it fly . it is impossible to maneuver , and trim correction is almost impossible to achieve . landing it is an absolute challenge . tried my best to like this one , but in the end , the drone itself prevented me from liking it : after a minor fall , the shaft from one of the servos broke , and the spare part is impossible to find .
__label__positive__ this met all our expectations ! it is so easy to change attachments and the directions help to figure out what piece goes with what attachment . highly recommend this kit for anyone looking for an affordable kit for the gopro !
__label__positive__ all ok .
__label__positive__ good tripod for the money .
__label__positive__ great system . easy to install
__label__positive__ usually i buy batteries by the original equipment manufacturer ( in this case , sony ) . however , the sony oem version no longer is available . i took a chance on the batteries sold by big mike . they took and are holding a full charge ! assuming they keep working , they are excellent , and a great bargain ! hooray ! thanks , big mike .
__label__positive__ i have an aw110 that i purchased two years ago and use it for work taking as many as 700 photos a day . i have used several different models of coolpix cameras for eight years doing insurance work . the aw110 that i bought new has lasted three time longer than any previous coolpix model and is still going strong . i purchased this refurbished aw110 as a backup , just in case , from beach camera . it is factory refurbished and looks like it was never used . i immediately checked it out to make sure all of the features i regularly use such as the wi-fi , gps , altimeter all work , and they do ; and it arrived on time . this is a great camera , is extremely durable and is an all around great value .
__label__positive__ great seller , fast shipment , just as described , totally pleased !
__label__positive__ have n't had time to try it but first impression is that it 's a quality product . i bought it to use at a wedding in august , after that i will let you know. < br / > price was right and build looks good .
__label__positive__ this camera is what a simple point and shoot should be . i 'm a nikon dslr shooter , but needed something to carry in my pocket that gave me better quality than my cell phone without a ridiculous amount of bulk , something that i could pull out quickly in casual situations and take a quick snap and not be disgusted by what it produced . for me , this camera fit that bill just perfectly . it focuses fast enough , though shot to shot time could be a bit snappier , but then again i 'm not going to be putting this camera to heavy duty uses. < br / > < br / > what it does do exceptionally well , is deliver a good quality snap , that 's usually well exposed with good colors . family gatherings , out with friends , at the fair , you will get solid results . if you do n't want to fiddle too much with settings , this little point and shoot will handle the heavy lifting while you focus on the most important thing , composition . frame , shoot , enjoy !
__label__positive__ awesome camera ! ! my kids love it : ) they really love getting the picture immediately and so do i. the picture quality is great for an instant camera !
__label__negative__ now i 'm happy because you changed this .
__label__positive__ fits my sony a5100 well . the flip down screen did get in the way but i just tightened it so that the screen does n't come completely down and is still free . feels sturdy . i have n't had to use for a prolonged period ( longer than 2 hours ) but for what i 've used it for so far , it has worked perfectly . much less bulky but more secure than shoulder strap . a bit dorky.. .. maybe ... .
__label__positive__ filter works fine
__label__neutral__ it would have been higher but lens cap keeper was not in the package ... minor thing but still
__label__positive__ i am in picture heaven . love all the photo equipment i reseaved . my d5300 is more than i expected . taking lots of pictures .
__label__positive__ very happy . great value in the bundle .
__label__positive__ i 've never been a fan of hand straps for a dslr , but since moving to the spider holster , i needed something to secure my camera ( s ) while shooting . ( they 're perfectly secure moving while in the holster ) this strap is the perfect compliment to the spider holster . it is comfortable , extremely adjustable , and simply feels like its part of the camera rather than something simply slapped on to give added support . i 'm thoroughly enjoying the spiderpro hand strap on both of my cameras and i will likely purchase a third for my backup camera since i do n't plan on ever taking them off my two primary cameras .
__label__positive__ although i 'm a videography noob , i was happy that the microphone picked up subtle sounds ... clear and no distortion . upping the db -5 or so and i was still clear . i think this was a very good deal . my starter microphone is a keeper . i will say that the cable was not to my liking . the bulky 1/4 to 1/8 mono was chunky and i 'm sure it is standard for many , my pentax k3 may be happier with a purchase of the 1/8th or 3.5mm right-angled plug to keep the snagging danger to a minimum .
__label__positive__ a must for the video buff that likes to do this type of thing themselves .
__label__positive__ good product
__label__neutral__ a good portrait lens for the price . i got it to compliment my range of manual lenses . i have only used it a couple of times , but was impressed with the results .
__label__positive__ it worked and arrived on time .
__label__positive__ works well , as expected .
__label__negative__ very difficult to use with slight wind . no wire frame around screen which makes it work like a sail .
__label__positive__ excellent buy . the camera and lenses alone are worth the price . do n't expect a lot from the quality of the backpack/camera bag as it is low end . i bought a higher end bag but the one that comes with it would work if one did not have another option . other reviews stated concerns regarding the tripod . the one that i got was a lightweight aluminum tripod , definitely not an upper end model . the tripod will hold the camera with any of the lenses included in the package . at some point i will probably invest in a higher end model but this will serve the purpose if one does not use a tripod much and wants to save money . the remote control works but it does not come with the attachment that allows the camera to be fully remote control operated . by that i mean , you have to set the settings of the camera to use this remote and they reset themselves after a few minutes if the remote is not being constantly used . if you buy the attachment you can bypass that feature on the camera and use get more use out of the remote . i just purchased a separate wired remote which does the job . the photo editing software is excellent and allows for a lot of flexibility in editing including editing raw formats . the lenses that came with it are nice but i was not completely satisfied with the zoom lens as it stated it was an auto lens but it does not function as such . you have to manually focus this lens . overall though this is a good package for the money for the beginner to intermediate photographer looking to upgrade .
__label__positive__ excellent
__label__positive__ built well and no slippage when locked !
__label__positive__ better than i thought it would be ! !
__label__positive__ perfect . as good as the one that came with my camera ( that i lost )
__label__neutral__ i have this camera set to 3840x2160 at 30fpt in front of my house and a car entering my driveway slowly at a distance of no more than 15 feet and if you want to go back and read the license plate , i can not . i purchased two of these things but i am sorry to say , i am very disappointed . my second camera arriving tomorrow. < br / > maybe it is that i did not know how these things work and i was expecting to be able to zoom in like on images taken by la lower quality picture taken bay a regular digital camera. < br / > if there is too much sun out , the glare is horrible and there is nothing to help the camera via axis camera management or companion . i would n't have minded paying a bit more but to get the video quality i was expecting ( this is my first time dealing with this systems and i know there is nothing better that i have been able to find out there ) .
__label__positive__ i purchased the 107x15 foot vinyl backdrop . i debated back and forth between the 12 and 15ft lengths and i believe i made the right decision . i wanted to be able to take full body length photos and this size is great . the backdrop is very heavy though . per others reviews i unrolled the entire backdrop and taped the end to the tube and rerolled it . which ended up being a really good thing because the first time i went to bring the backdrop down it unrolled very quickly and the duct tape kept it from all crashing down . clamps are definitely needed , i purchase 1in spring clamps for 99 cents each at the hardware store and they work great .
__label__negative__ although , i liked the solid feel to this product compared to many of the other door access controllers i 've ordered and tested , i was unable to get the doorbell button to work properly on this unit . on similar controllers , the door bell button creates a contact closure which you can then use to either enable an actual door bell or buzzer , turn on a light , etc . but , with this particular unit , there was no contact closure across the doorbell leads when the doorbell button was pressed . i also could not measure any voltage change , etc. < br / > originally , i thought i may have gotten a bad unit , so i ordered a second only to discover it had the same issue. < br / > so , if you are looking for a working doorbell button ( button icon on lower left of number pad ) , i ca n't recommend this unit . if however , you are just looking to use this for keypad entry or rfid cards or tags , then it worked fine and has a nice solid feel to it . this unit also seemed like it was well sealed and would hold up to outdoor conditions better than some others that i looked at .
__label__positive__ good
__label__negative__ no instructions on what the circular grip and male circle grip are for.. no way to adjust camera view horizontally on the x axis , forcing you to
__label__positive__ thanks great item great price lovely pictures
__label__positive__ it was well packaged and exactly as described . i 'm happy with my purchase .
__label__negative__ this is horrible only because mine turned out to be a fake . it would n't work and looking at pictures of the same camera , they looked nothing alike . : (
__label__positive__ i love this little guy ! feels solid and stable , adjusts easily , and packs into a small space . keep in mind what it is -- a small stabilizing platform for a bridge camera or lightweight dslr -- not a full-sized professional tripod . i bought mine for supporting a small light panel , but i use it mostly for my camera now . i 'm a small woman but it fits comfortably in the back pocket of my jeans . the ingenious design allows it to sit on a table as a tripod or , when folded , to use as a handheld mount that helps to stabilize video . ca n't beat it for the price .
__label__positive__ yup . got exactly the real-deal i ordered quickly . thanks ! cb
__label__neutral__ i was hoping it be shorter due to i want to take it to foot ball games and use it for my 300 mm camera . you ca n't even take an umbrella in .
__label__neutral__ good
__label__positive__ came ahead of schedule , works fine .
__label__positive__ works great .
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid:76c469928c46173787a5e453d231c264 ] ] awesome light for the money ! worked perfect as the finishing touch i needed for even lighting ! i bought a second one in addition to this one ! very happy with this purchase !
__label__positive__ i spent almost as much time choosing a camera strap as i did choosing my camera . it 's the details that matter . this strap is super comfortable and does not hurt my neck . i am often with a group of photographers and everyone has the same black strap , but not me ! so , i always know which camera is mine if i set it down or let someone borrow it . the design is great and is often complemented . want to be even more fabulous ? then buy the strap !
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ very easy to install and sync with existing system . i will be adding more when i expand my system
__label__positive__ this product is handy , great purchase !
__label__positive__ the best deal in a ttl flash . complete kit with off camera remote . everything except batteries included . ttl zoom flash pairs perfectly with nikon 5200 . if you need a flash but unwilling to spend $ 300-400 for nikon branded one , this is what you want .
__label__positive__ i love this thing . works like a charm- allows for new trigger options on my fuji
__label__positive__ there are many things to like about this bag . let 's start with that. < br / > < br / > it 's a small backpack designed to hold two gopros and some accessories securely . the case is very well made . the material feels great , the zippers smooth , it is comfortable to wear ( in one position - more on this later ) and while wearing it , you can easily swivel it to the front to access the items in it . thought has been given to small details , like an oversized zipper pull so that it is easier to grab when wearing gloves. < br / > < br / > it has one main compartment ( where the foam insert goes in ) with two zippered pockets ( cables , memory cards ) , one smaller compartment where you can put accessories , and a tiny compartment lined with a softer material for a cell phone - that should just barely fit the largest phones today . there 's a smaller phone pouch on the main strap that will not fit a phone with a 5 & # 34 ; or larger screen . i wish the front pouch is not there , so that i can use a polar pro backpack mount. < br / > < br / > the foam insert is easily removable . i suppose you could get your own foam insert built for custom gear . the one supplied will hold two gopros inside a waterproof case ( they must be inside the case , or it will rattle around ) , two bacpacs ( battery or lcd ) , one wireless remote , and two batteries. < br / > < br / > the most comfortable way to wear this is to sling it diagonally , with the strap resting on the left shoulder - as shown in the video . you could wear it on your right shoulder by not slinging it diagonally , but it is not as secure or comfortable . there 's a smaller cross strap to further secure it so that it does n't move around . that small strap needs to be unclasped to swing the back forward to access the backpack - or to hold it in front when you 're in a crowded place and you 're worried about pickpockets. < br / > < br / > i think this bag deserves more than 4 stars , but not quite 5 stars , due to the high price and inflexibility with the inserts .
__label__neutral__ water proof case had a crack in the rear seam so no underwater shots for me ... .
__label__negative__ several issues i had with this holder and my tg-4. < br / > < br / > first the lanyard end separated from the rest of the lanyard , without any tension on it . it just came off . clearly defective . good thing the camera was not supported by the lanyard when that happened. < br / > < br / > second it is impossible to say if the camera is level ( most of my videos are sideways to the left or to the right ) or even if it is level . i went mountain biking and all i could see on the resulting video was my front wheel . i tried to adjust the position and went back riding , now it was pointing too high . then i went horseback riding . i tried to find a good position but it was pointing too high . the problem is not seeing the viewfinder at all , it is impossible to tell until after shooting the video. < br / > < br / > finally to start/stop videos , i had to take the camera out of the holder and put it back in . every time .
__label__positive__ inexpensive general purpose lens . bought this as a replacement for a lost lens . packaged perfectly and arrived quickly !
__label__positive__ pretty great for the price .
__label__positive__ i recived this within a week and it is perfect for my fuji ! !
__label__positive__ very nice
__label__neutral__ fine
__label__positive__ the glasses were wonderful but the strap was not good at all . the weight of the binoculars made the strap cut into your neck .
__label__positive__ i bought this even though the review did n't seem great and i was very satisfied when it arrived . the packaging kept the dome well protected . the dome itself was in great condition and my first day with this product i took it out in the ocean for some cool pictures and was not disappointed . after finally taking it for third venture out in the ocean it started to get water spots inside the dome itself . i sent telesin a picture and within a week and a half they sent me a brand new dome that had a different shape to the dome and looked a lot more like a top shelf product . it 's been a week and this one has yet to show any problems . highly satisfied with my product and service !
__label__negative__ there is no app and therefore rate this as useless for anyone using the camera to our pictures to your ipad . dont buy it
__label__positive__ excellent monopod . it comes with a phone holder and it is also good for camera . most importantly , it locks , which allows to install a phone or a camera without any fears . it looks sturdy , i hope it will last . it comes with phone holder and a screw for gopro .
__label__neutral__ when sliding the black tab into the hotshoe , it seems to turn off my canon t3i 's light sensing capabilities . when i set the flash to & # 34 ; always on & # 34 ; and use the tab in the hotshoe , the flash wo n't go off at all . only when i take the tab out of the hotshoe does the flash go off .
__label__negative__ not for me . maybe someone else will be able to find that & # 34 ; sweet spot ' . i found it impossible to focus and oveall was just a waste of $ . i sent it back within a day .
__label__positive__ very reliable wireless ettl trigger . this trigger is killing the , over priced , us competitive market . they 're great at transmitting data aaccurately , at impressive distances . when used with the yn-622c-tx , change settings is easy and quick .
__label__negative__ it 's ok i was expecting the whole thing lit up
__label__positive__ excellent hi resolution video surveillance camera , can be controlled remotely so it can pan and zoom remotely provides good color video when there is enough light and monochrome video using infrared in the dark .
__label__positive__ very good quality . love the carrying case !
__label__positive__ a superb piece of kit which comfortably allows me to use a gemini 500 pro and a 22in . beauty dish for great fill-in flash , out on location away from a mains cable . indispensable for shooting glamour on more remote beaches on the spanish islands of ibiza and mallorca . for my purposes an absolutely perfect solution and well worth its price tag .
__label__positive__ works as well as any other filter set - and reasonably priced .
__label__neutral__ good quality and feels very good on your hands everything so far works perfectly , except the wireless remote control that comes with it , did n't work for the very first time , ( does n't connect with the camera ) and i do n't know if i can return only the control back ? because the grip just work fine !
__label__positive__ great price . both batteries are working well in my canon s1 camera .
__label__positive__ great fit ...
__label__positive__ great batteries . a lot better than the standard gopro batteries .
__label__neutral__ it 's a good product for biggner who just started but i think there are much better ones to use .
__label__positive__ great seller - delivered as promised !
__label__positive__ i was a little skeptical about this product at first . i could n't wrap my mind around the fact that a small strap could actually make your camera float . well , it does . even though this strap is of the polaroid brand , it fits my nikon aw120 perfectly . i have had this strap in the ocean and in many pools , and i have been thankful for it in each place . it floats and it is a bright color , so it would be difficult to misplace it .
__label__positive__ use it as a protector for my & # 34 ; garage construction camera. & # 34 ; mine came with a perfectly strong magnet . the naugahyde tends to roll off the edges after spending a week or two in my jeans pocket but the cushioned case protected my camera very well . for the money this is a very protective case .
__label__negative__ does n't work very good
__label__positive__ i bought this for my daughter and she is loving it . she is taking beautiful photos of animals and will start landscapes after summer flooding ends . but for now she is having a great time learning .
__label__neutral__ buyer beware -- whatever nest did to & # 34 ; update & # 34 ; the dropcam -- huge fail . this version is much more challenging to install -- requires scanning a qr code & pc for set-up . took me about 1 hour to set-up ; dropcam was seamless . also the nestcam does n't work with the dropcam app . so if you own other dropcams , this is a big disappointment .
__label__positive__ my granddaughter loves to take pictures , and she has wanted one of these for a long time . it 's so lightweight and easy to use that an 11-year-old can use it . now she can take selfies with her friends and share her new gadget . the product came nicely packaged , and there was no problem with the seller or order whatsoever .
__label__positive__ good if you do n't drop it ! : )
__label__positive__ great for my trips to the middle of nowhere !
__label__positive__ it cracked a bit to easily but did protect the screen .
__label__neutral__ the reason i can not give this product a really good review is because the camera that i received produces tilted images . this could not be corrected , and there was nothing in the owners manual to address this problem . i decided to order a replacement camera and just pay for it myself . the flying of the craft is fine ... .the problem is just with the camera .
__label__positive__ i am not sure of which knockoff cam this is , however , i have used this thing hiking , house hunting , in my drag car , in the pool and on the baseball field and it never skips a beat . i was surprised by the picture quality , even under water ! battery life was just over an hour while i was playing softball and had it linked to my phone with someone else using the controls ... which by the way is an awesome feature !
__label__positive__ i paired this sigma 19mm and the 30mm with the panasonic 45-150 for a well-rounded set of focal lengths with similar quality ( metal/brass mounts , polished metal finishes on top , and modest apertures ) . this is my second time trying micro-four thirds format and since the first time , sigma has produced some intriguing lenses which made me give the format another try . and of course , my subject choice has changed away from wildlife to urban shooting which i believe these new lenses are worth a try .
__label__neutral__ my vacation was basically ruined because of this camera ( and the 12-35 2.8 ) taking water in whenever i took it to a beach or pool . the camera did get splashed , but never submerged . i have pentax k5 cameras and with their wr lenses , they have never suffered any water damage . you can see videos online of people hosing down their pentaxes with no trouble . the worst part of the lumix combo is actually the 12-35 lens , which is separate and very expensive . that thing sucks water in easily. < br / > the viewfinder in the gh4 got foggy on the first visit to the beach and remained that way for ten days . it 's very humid in the caribbean , so that did n't help . i used a blow drier gently to help things a little but the 12-35 refused to work up until today , here at the airport terminal , going home. < br / > < br / > to its defense , everything works now , but when things were bad , even the sensor got a droplet which i tried to clean as best as i could . something i have never deared to do before , but these were desperate times . next time i bring my pentax gear or just buy an olympus tough . panasonic should not make such high claims , their stuff is definitely not splash proof .
__label__neutral__ system is perfect ... easy to install . however , to view the cameras on the phone , you have to permanently connect the camera monitor to a computer . not good . the newer models do not require this , and therefore , i would recommend the new models .
__label__positive__ thank you !
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ i bought these for those nights i did n't want to drag my telescope out . i wanted some binoculars for casual star gazing while relaxing in a lawn chair . i 'd been using some nikon 10 x 50 ( action extreme ) and was really very pleased with them , but i thought i 'd go for more aperture , therefore , i looked at the celestron dedicated astronomical binoculars , etc . all their magnifications were too high for hand held use . if i was going to have to mount binoculars on a tripod , i 'd rather drag out the telescope . therefore , i wanted something else. < br / > < br / > i was willing to spend much more , but i wanted a big aperture , with magnification 10x or below as these were strictly for hand held use . the cornell ornithology lab rated the celestron nature dx 8 x 42 as & # 34 ; best in class & # 34 ; in their 2013 binocular review , which carried a lot of weight in making my decision. < br / > < br / > diopter/focus : < br / > i 'm glad i got these ; they are sturdy , seem well built , and are fairly easy to hold ( hold steady , that is ) for star gazing . the diopter adjustment is firm , and focused perfectly . overall focus was quick and precise , i was really amazed at how quickly focus was achieved. < br / > < br / > optics : < br / > while not really expensive , these binoculars have great depth of field , good color rendering , no flare/coma , and a good , bright field . there is minor edge distortion , but that is to be expected in this price range . the phase corrected roof prism coatings do their job well and the light transmission is very good ( to my eyes , anyway ) . the exit pupil on this is huge , due to the large aperture . fully multi-coated optics as well. < br / > < br / > mechanics : < br / > as mentioned , focus was precise and quick . i like the focus adjustment being closer to the eyepieces on these rather than further away as on traditional porro prism binoculars because you have less tendency to accidentally move the focus . the adjustable eyecups were not as precise and firm as on the nikon 's , but i have them extended all the way out ( i do n't wear eyeglasses ) and it 's really a non-issue . eye relief is a whopping 18.2 degrees , and that should make these great binoculars for eyeglass wearers too . it was a challenge to get the inter-pupillary distance set properly , and took a little patience . once adjusted , it seems like it will stay in position as the hinge is quite firm , as is the focus wheel.. < br / > < br / > external : < br / > the body is poly carbonate , with a nice rubber like coating that seems like it will hold up . the ergonomics of the barrels , etc . are different than porro type binoculars and will take some getting used to , but these naturally rest in the hands and come to viewing position quite easily . the eyepiece cover is quite frankly something that will get lost quickly as it is loose , and comes off easily . the objective covers are fastened to the barrel ( ala steiner ) and are a soft silicone material . they seem like they 'd hold up alright. < br / > < br / > peripherals : < br / > the case is really nice ; nylon web type material , with a military style compression clasp closure . the case lid has an inside pocket ( very nice ) and the case has it 's own padded strap . the strap for the binoculars is one of the most comfortable i 've ever used , it has a padded , stretch type neoprene shoulder pad that is really comfortable . instructions are clear and precise , and a lens cleaning cloth is included. < br / > < br / > conclusion : < br / > i ca n't think of a better way to explore ( low power ) casual star gazing . these are a joy to use , are well made , water/fog proof , with a lifetime warranty . the large objectives really fill your view with the beauty of the night sky . even in light polluted phoenix skies , these are great . i suspect that the phase corrected prism coatings are the big item on these responsible for the astounding value. < br / > < br / > note : these may be great for birding and terrestrial viewing , but i ca n't comment on that use. < br / > < br / > i recommend these for anyone with less than $ 200 to spend who wants a great , reliable , optically close to perfect set of star gazing binoculars . i really could n't find anything less than $ 400 that meets the specs . of these celestron 's . i looked at the nikon monarch 5 but they did not have the aperture i wanted ( the monarch 's were 42mm ) . < br / > < br / > you will be very very happy with these. < br / > < br / > two year update : 09-2017 : these are still the one 's i reach for for casual backyard stargazing . i 've had a lot of time to compare these to the 10 x 50 nikon 's i also use , and even though i think the nikon 's optics are marginally better , the brightness and field of view for these celestrons makes them my grab and go choice . however , even at 10x ; they are a challenge to get focused and get a steady visual due to the objective lens size being 56mm , rather than 50 mm , as in the nikon 's . are the nikon 's better ? overall , marginally yes . but the wide fov with as well as their brightness makes them a real joy to use . these are much heavier than the nikon 's , but not too heavy for long term use . for terrestrial and birding , i prefer the nikons. < br / > < br / > absolutely no problems with these , no loose eyecups , no issues what-so-ever . just a good , solid pair of glasses that you 'll use a long time . highly recommended ! d who wants a great , reliable , optically close to perfect set of star gazing binoculars . i really could n't find anything less than $ 400 that meets the specs . of these celestron 's . i looked at the nikon monarch 5 but they did not have the aperture i wanted ( the monarch 's were 42mm ) . < br / > < br / > you will be very very happy with these .
__label__negative__ the spec says still picture resolution is 1280x1024 . not even close . so bad that you ca n't recognize peoples ' faces 30 feet away. < br / > < br / > posted pic is of maple tree leaves at a distance of about 15 feet. < br / > < br / > another worthless piece of junk from china . amazon is ruining its ' reputation by letting junk like this be marketed on the site !
__label__positive__ the first picture got stuck and ruined in both cartridges .
__label__positive__ the pictures are great , i kove this camera .
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ great camera
__label__negative__ the flash i received only has one contact and ground , not the 5 contacts the my a65 has . should have known it was too good to be true
__label__positive__ i have been using this lens for about 4 years now with my pentax dlsr cameras and it is an excellent fast lens . the best part of the camera is being able to long zoom distant objects and the auto focus on the lens works fast and locks the focus very quickly . i have taken a variety of pictures in several different conditions and it works like a champ every single time .
__label__positive__ i have really enjoyed this lens . i know there are better lenses but for the price this ca n't be bet . just a fun lens !
__label__positive__ great product
__label__neutral__ i was really excited to get this camera and try it out while i was traveling in europe . i was looking for the increased optical zoom from my old nikon point and shoot and higher mp , excited about the ability to share through wi-fi/nfc , and hoping the dim-light when you ca n't use flash would be better . i tried to do a few test pictures before leaving and compared it with the camera on my new phone , a galaxy s6 . outdoors , the camera seemed to get a bit more detail , but indoors with the lights off since i new i would be in museums and dim cathedrals , the phone was way better than the camera , which is strange since they 're both samsung . i carried both phone and camera for about a week , using phone indoors and both outdoors to keep comparing . then i did n't bother with the camera anymore . i might have missed the extra zoom a few times , but really i did n't miss any of the other special shot/effects or the quality of this camera . it was faster , easier and sometimes less conspicuous , and lighter to just keep up with my phone .
__label__positive__ so awesome to have another battery ready to go . these are working great. < br / > recommended .
__label__positive__ great as expected . very easy to use . only used it once at our pool , but taking it to hawaii for snorkeling & etc . if it breaks or malfunctions , will update this review ! < br / > < br / > video was on default settings , just hit record & it was good to go .
__label__positive__ great product & price !
__label__positive__ very happy with this . i have an old sony @ 200 . i had spots showing up on my pictures.so after much searching i decided to order this kit . i was nervous to try it . i really did n't want to damage the camera . the kit came with simple easy instructions . so i gave it a try and i am so glad i did . my pictures are now clear . thank you so much . you saved me from a costly repair bill or a camera replacement .
__label__negative__ i consider myself a fairly & # 34 ; tech savvy & # 34 ; person , but i can not , for the life of me , get this thing to work correctly . i created an account and got it set up so that it uses my home wifi , but it will not start recording . i inserted a micro sd card because i thought maybe that was the problem , but it did n't help . it just keeps saying that the device is offline even though it tells me that it has connected to my wifi successfully . i 've been messing with this thing all day and i ca n't get it to work . i 've tried looking online for a solution to my problem but i have n't been able to find anything remotely helpful . i absolutely hate leaving bad reviews , but as it stands now , this thing is completely useless to me .
__label__negative__ have lost its configuration a few times for no reson . the clarity of the picture is poor . sound and mic do nto work every time . not the best camera ptz . i have 4 and this one is the worst .
__label__positive__ not bad for an inexpensive softbox . the only i can foresee is the flash mount merely wedges between the folds of the softbox itself . the feel this wrak piit in the design will eventually tear/ wear away
__label__positive__ had them for 1 month and are working great . the only complaint if any is the screws that come with it . one broke while i was installing it on wood .
__label__positive__ great for the price
__label__negative__ mine does not work . they motion sensor does n't work . it records all. < br / > i got it for when we go out of town . the device only records continuessly for 4 hours . it does not help when you 're gone for longer .
__label__positive__ works good
__label__positive__ perfect !
__label__positive__ i read all the negative reviews and i have been flying phantom quad copters every since they came out and i an experience drone pilot but i must say that a lot of the problems i hear i know it 's coming from people trying to fly out further than they should because they hear is someone else has gone two miles out and using these cheap android devices with slow processors . practice and stay safe and try and beware of software bugs because they do happen and can be responsible for crashing but always test a safe flight after an update , it 's a safe bet that 99 % of the complaints is from user error and people crashing the quad and wanting a replacement because it do n't work right after the crash.. < br / > using cheap sd cards and not upgrading firmware properly , dji customer service is a joke but the product is superior ...
__label__positive__ happy to have this on my nx1 .
__label__positive__ much better quality audio than the dslr normally has , and really that 's really all i was looking for . this comes at a great price for the quality you get . there is a slight hum in the background of the audio , but it can be removed in post pretty easily .
__label__positive__ this is a kick but lens . it took me awhile to figure it out . at first i could not get any sharp photos handheld until i read an article online from lensrental about super telephoto lens . they clearly tell you that you must learn how to hold and practice shooting with it . working with telephoto lens you have learn how aim through narrow focus vision and dealing with a heavy object in your hands. < br / > < br / > what i found that really worked for me was adding the strap to the lens it comes with . the strap will act as a stabilizer when you tighten up enough to hold your camera in position for picture taking . with the strap and os you can get clean and sharp photos hand held. < br / > < br / > the usb doc is another great feature for tweaking and refining your custom setting . it gives you the options to set focus limit distance to make focusing faster . i wish sigma would give some tutorials on using the software for making the custom setting. < br / > < br / > please do n't be alarmed if your like me you had such high hopes only to realize that the darn thing is not working like thry claimed. < br / > do n't give up but do your homework and you will see that the lens really is that good .
__label__positive__ honestly , this camera has such great picture quality . pros would be great picture quality , awesome durability and the macro mode works great for taking close up photos . the only con i had is there is n't any real lens protection and could get scratched up . i used this on a week long back country trip with lots of rugged ground being covered .
__label__positive__ this is the second one i have purchased ( for a second camera . ) primarily , this is to protect the contacts on the hot shoe . the addition of the level is a plus if you shoot panoramas on a tripod .
__label__negative__ arrived with tear at the seam .
__label__positive__ i bought this for my nex 5 camera to use when we went to yellowstone this summer . it is a fine lens but it is rather heavy for the camera . however , i am pleased that i had it with me because i got some excellent photos !
__label__neutral__ too big .
__label__positive__ good deal , effective rags .
__label__positive__ great camera . little on the larger side but the variable focus is a must for changing environments .
__label__positive__ i 'm a beginning hobbyist so take my thoughts on this lens with that in mind . i think its a great lens and an amazing value . i 've included a few images taken with the lens over my first 72 hours of ownership . luckily , the day the lens arrived there was a full moon . i mounted the lens to a d750 , threw it on a tripod and waited for a window in the clouds to get the moon shot . i have zero background in astrophotography so i 'm sure it leaves a lot to be desired but that moon picture is miles better than anything i 've tried in the past , even though there was a lot of smoke in the atmosphere from the forest fires a couple of states away . the photograph of the bee was taken just beyond the minimum focus distance , at 600mm , i cropped away probably 3/4 of the photo . the picture of the mountain goats is one i 'd like to be able to take again ; i think i had the shutter speed at 1/125 which was waaaay too slow for moving animals but it does show how well the optical stabilization works as the shot was handheld at 600mm. < br / > < br / > the lens compares favorably to my nikon 70-200 f4 . i took a shot of a distant flower in my neighbors yard with the sigma 150-600mm set at 200mm and the nikion 70-200mm also at 200mm . the sigma was just as sharp as the nikon , my untrained eye could n't tell the difference between the two photos . i then did a comparison at 400mm between the sigma 150-600mm and the nikon 70-200mm with a tc-20e iii . nikon lists their 70-200mm f4 as being compatible with the tc-20e iii but with auto-focus limitations ; it auto-focused fine on my d750 . this is where the sigma was the clear winner , it was much sharper . now i 'm wondering why i ever invested in the 2x teleconverter in the first place , oh i remember , because this lens was n't available at the time ! < br / > < br / > the build quality is really good , it has a quality feel to it but i can definitely tell it 's not a nikon lens . a nikon lens just has an excellent tactile feel to it that 's hard to describe in words . factor in the value proposition of the sigma and the build quality exceeded my expectations. < br / > < br / > i really appreciated the light weight . the lens mounted on a d750 ( without the tripod mount ) was 6lbs 2oz total . my arms did get tired shooting with it and that 's when i realized i really would n't want to add much more weight to my setup if i 'm going to shoot handheld. < br / > < br / > i used the sigma usb dock ( not included ) to program my personal preferences which are then selected via a three position switch on the lens . it took less than 5 minutes and worked flawlessly . having the ability to adjust preferences and update firmware via software is a very nice feature. < br / > < br / > i only have one minor complaint , the focus ring is n't very wide at all . this might be a moot point as the auto-focus worked fast and nearly flawlessly . i only used manual focus when i took the shot of the moon.s . factor in the value proposition of the sigma and the build quality exceeded my expectations. < br / > < br / > i really appreciated the light weight . the lens mounted on a d750 ( without the tripod mount ) was 6lbs 2oz total . my arms did get tired shooting with it and that 's when i realized i really would n't want to add much more weight to my setup if i 'm going to shoot handheld. < br / > < br / > i used the sigma usb dock ( not included ) to program my personal preferences which are then selected via a three position switch on the lens . it took less than 5 minutes and worked flawlessly . having the ability to adjust preferences and update firmware via software is a very nice feature. < br / > < br / > i only have one minor complaint , the focus ring is n't very wide at all . this might be a moot point as the auto-focus worked fast and nearly flawlessly . i only used manual focus when i took the shot of the moon .
__label__positive__ as most i just started using it ... .and the pictures were good ... .then i read the manualand the pictures became great . the only thing i missed was the eu power conector . as many travel globally with their camera it should be possible to power-up anywere . it even has a gps funtion to tell you were you are !
__label__positive__ perfect ! great vendor !
__label__positive__ works well , very good price .
__label__positive__ the dji phantom 3 is one of the best for your money , it will do everything they say it will do , the flying is so wonderful just make sure you follow the rules of your state so you do n't mess it up for others .
__label__negative__ by far , this camera 's biggest problem is taking pictures in sunlight . you can not see the lcd screen even when you try to shade the screen . during our vacation , we had to aim in the general direction of the subject and take a couple pictures , hoping we took a good one . we had the same problem when we were snorkeling . we could not see the screen taking surface pictures , only when diving . the camera does go through batteries ; we had to use a fresh set everyday . some of our pictures were missing when i downloaded them although this may have been operator error . the quality of the pictures were inconsistent ; however , we did get some really clear photos with great color quality . the camera was very durable- dropping it , etc.. the camera never leaked . in summary , if you 're buying this camera for a young child , it might work out for you . if you are using it to preserve memories , i 'd encourage you to find something else .
__label__positive__ these are the best ones , especially if u use a storage case
__label__positive__ good backdrop for your money
__label__positive__ love it
__label__positive__ this product performs perfectly on my nikon d3200 and i expect it will be just fine when i upgrade to a better camera body . in bright sunlight it is nearly impossible to see the display screen without a device such as this . it can be attached and detached easily . i do n't keep it mounted on my camera at all times because the camera plus a good lens and this shade make for difficult storage in a camera bag . i 'm very happy with this product .
__label__positive__ this is a fantastic product . after only a little practice i ’ m able to swap the lenses between my a6000 camera body and the lens flipper in between 8 and 9 seconds reliably . even with my top opening camera bag there is no way i could ever come close to that unless i didn ’ t bother with rear caps and just tossed the lens i just took off my camera in the already unzipped bag . needless to say not an option except in emergency. < br / > < br / > the build quality is good . your lenses mount to the flipper the same way they would to your camera and just as securely with a mechanical release button for each side . the releases are on the opposite side for each end . this means that when you swap lenses and it flips over , the release buttons will still be in the same place relative to you . i recommend paying attention to where the buttons are when you put it on . ( is the bottom release on the inside or outside ? ) if you always put it on the same way muscle memory will help speed up the processes . the strap is the perfect length for me to be worn diagonally across my chest but very tall or larger individuals may need a longer one . you ’ ll want the flipper to rest 3-5 inches above your hip where it is easy to reach but not in the way. < br / > < br / > i ’ d recomend this to any photographer amature or pro that does any kind of field work .
__label__positive__ it is a very good deal for the amateur photographer . i love the pictures that it takes . very simple to operate .
__label__positive__ nice heavy weight batteries , work same as canon . i have bought some batteries before that you could feel the weight difference and they were trash . a+++++
__label__positive__ was a replacement for one lost
__label__positive__ very good product . i have had excellent tech support from kenneth as well as other tech support personnel .
__label__positive__ fit my d3200 perfect . only issue is the clips to hold the battery 's in are not great . the main one wo n't hold it at all and the second lets the battery come loose . fixed it with a small plastic wedge above both clips .
__label__neutral__ works well and nice videos for the price .
__label__positive__ protects my camera so well along with being very fancy .
__label__positive__ is so nice ... good quality
__label__positive__ they work . have n't determined how they hold a charge in the long term .
__label__neutral__ the tripod stand is the cheapest i have ever seen in the world . the box of the lens where just white and it did not look to be from original packing despite what the claim is. < br / > the bag was really good. < br / > the external flash is again a cheap product that brought down the deal 's value. < br / > the camera itself came in a good package and i am happy for that. < br / > if you are fascinated by the looks of the tripod stand and the external flash , please go elsewhere . this bundle is not the place for you .
__label__negative__ when i received these , they were missing two filters , and duplicates for two filters . had to return back to amazon . quality control should be better .
__label__positive__ i 've only used them for one test shoot ; however , they have n't overheated and exploded like other cheap speedlights that i 've purchased when used with my external battery packs . for the moment , i 'm giving these products a glowing review . you can see a sample test shot using this flash in a photo attached .
__label__positive__ works as advertised . gave me great time lapse photos .
__label__positive__ good cheap tripod and selfie stick , but the tripod is wobbly due to the small feet .
__label__positive__ my father , steve bingham has a ms in photography from brooks institute . he has thoroughly tested this lens , both with an iso 12233 ( 2'x3 ' ) chart and with distant detail . he says it has more resolution than any dx lens he has ever tested ! wow . at 80mm it equals the new sony 90mm macro ( fx ) which just a few months ago was the sharpest fx lenses he had ever tested.the only weakness is some barrel distortion at 16mm , easily corrected in adobe camera raw . at 1 pound , this lens is totally awesome !
__label__positive__ this product is a very good , it lets you know when someone is either coming on your drive way or on your drive way . thanks amazon .
__label__positive__ sub par .
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ just what i was looking for , was great
__label__positive__ this was a great product for my 79 year old mother . simple to use and color code works out great .
__label__positive__ bought this kit while on vacation having forgotten to pack my charger . this kit was cheaper than one original charger so the batteries were a bonus . i did n't expect much from it , and to be honest , was a little paranoid about using 'cheap ' batteries in my equipment. < br / > however , 2 years on and these batteries live in my camera . they are great ! they last longer than the original and have never faltered . they work fine in the oem charger and vice versa . my only criticism would be that the camera does n't seem to be able to sense how much charge is left - it goes from displaying a full battery to almost flat very suddenly . but i can live with that since i always have a couple of spares to swap in .
__label__negative__ big mistake buying this one . in fact sony should reimburse me for this purchase . the protector lasted about a day before falling off and for it to fit on my a7r mark ii 's lcd screen , i had to flip it upside down so as not to cover the information . i expect better from sony brand .
__label__positive__ great look and feel of glass . fits very true to size with minimal gap between edges . so much better than a non-transferable substitute
__label__positive__ the battery charged quickly and lasts really long
__label__positive__ easy to use , organized all my gopro accessories in one place . exactly what i wanted .
__label__positive__ the case is big enough for my dslr nikon plus the battery charger and some accessories . it has plenty of room and is well made !
__label__positive__ excellent construction very solid and stable , and the wheels are very smooth in motion . i recommend it
__label__positive__ well made , good price , would buy from this vendor again
__label__positive__ great product for the price ! would recommend purchasing in lieu of the expensive gopro brand .
__label__negative__ every picture it takes leaves a blurry corner
__label__positive__ works great with the kit lens for my nikon d7000 . highly recommended !
__label__positive__ works normally .
__label__positive__ works great .
__label__positive__ incredible lens !
__label__negative__ never received any information
__label__positive__ my nikon d90 camera had several & # 34 ; rings & # 34 ; in the image caused by canned air propellant on the sensor . not terrible , but i knew they were there -- especially when using the visualize spots feature in lightroom . i debated whether or not to send it in or clean it myself . read all the reviews on products to clean camera sensors and decided to give these a try . watch an instructional video in youtube and jumped in . first pass with one brush and 2 drops of cleaner removed about 90 percent of the spots . second pass using the same method and targeting the final two propellant & # 34 ; rings & # 34 ; cleaned them as well . i shot two test images and viewed in lightroom . perfect . not a spot to be seen . cost me just15 bucks and 20 minutes of my time -- and i still have 12 brushes and a full bottle of cleaner to be used if needed later on !
__label__positive__ great bag for my manfrotto tripod . well made and looks great .
__label__negative__ hmm quality of the construction is solid and looks good , but i found that using camera under water and then on sun the lens sweats from inside . also lcd screen had same issue . all covers was closed and using in normal conditions .
__label__positive__ very good product ! i ca n't tell the difference between them and the original . i have only used them a couple of times but they charge and recharge quickly . plan to buy again .
__label__positive__ awesome camera for the price . there is not much to complain about other than the fact that you can not disable the automatic picture review .
__label__positive__ niiiiiccceee ! love it !
__label__positive__ excellent , heavy duty
__label__positive__ bought this for my wife because she likes to take pictures but was not satisfied with most point and shoot cameras . i used slrs for decades but my wife did n't want to carry around the lenses . this camera takes great pictures ! if you ca n't take a good picture with this camera then you do n't know the difference between aperture priority and shutter priority .
__label__neutral__ main pocket is large enough to comfortably hold the powershot elph 350 and the padding seems sufficient to protect the camera against most ordinary bumps . accessory pocket is too small and tight to hold the spare batteries and memory cards i had expected to put into it . the zipper for the opening takes up too much space and makes access to the pocket 's contents difficult . the belt loop should work alright but i do n't wear a belt . a clip would be more practical for most users .
__label__positive__ sucks well
__label__neutral__ very simple to use . that it 's . all the pictures will have to be worked on in softwares like photoshop .
__label__neutral__ i learned the hard way that this camera is not good at action shots .
__label__positive__ my holy stone rc quadcopter i purchased is phenomenal . i fly it all the time ( daily ) and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking to get into flying a quadcopter to learn on before a big purchase . this quadcopter has a camera that is great , everything works out of the box as intended and it 's been a fun learning experience/wear out the dog purchase i 've ever made. < br / > < br / > some things to consider when using this copter ( that i 've learned the hard way ) , buying extra batteries is not a bad idea . i purchased the holystone batteries that are slightly bigger at 650mah along with the charger . if you decide to just use the charger cable that came with the batteries , remember to take the battery off after 1 hour on the charger ( which is the time to fully charge and fly for about 10min ) and do not plug your cable into a wall wart , only use your computer usb port . id say buy the charger and 2 spare batteries for like 15 bucks because it auto turns off for you once the batteries are charged ( seems to recognize a full battery based on voltage rather than a timer ) < br / > < br / > i bought enloop batteries and charger for the controller and have flown for probably 8 hours now on a single charge . i read somewhere else that someone was changing batteries every couple of flights so i went rechargeable , but you should be fine with some decent batteries ( not those dollar store ones ... .. im talking duracell or energizer ) < br / > < br / > i also had to buy the set of 4 replacement motors because with the batteries i thought i could change out the batteries with no down time , but i shorted a motor . id suggest waiting 10mins between flights to cool motors ( working for me so far ) . i also shorted a motor by letting my fiance fly it ... . i fly without guards and she crashed it into the ground and did n't kill the throttle which burned out a 2nd motor . no problem , remove old leads , replace with new motors and you 're good to go. < br / > < br / > final piece of advice is only fly outdoors . it 's way too tough flying indoors without crashing . use the right trigger to change mode to quick flight and you should be able to fly through moderately windy days without too much issue. < br / > < br / > overall it 's a great first learner not as good as a dj phantom , but at such a huge difference in price , well worth it . hopefully some of my experience is useful to others , i think this is a great investment . even when i crash landed in the pool , sunk to the bottom and pulled the copter out some many seconds later , 1 hour infront of a fan and the thing fired right back up and has been fine ever since . the only thing i kind of regret is not paying 40 more bucks for a fov camera , but not enough to dock points or be disappointed in anyway with this fantastic device , but maybe for the future ...
__label__positive__ six for 7 bucks . the only problem with this product is the ship time , but i was told at time of shipping how long it would take ( i amjust impatient ) . the product is what it claims to be ... made from heavy-stock paper , it easily folds into position . the images are accurate . plus , you get six of them . if you do n't know how to use it , then either read up or skip this product . but for the price and what you get , it is a time saver . your camera needs to have the af micro focus adjust feature . if it does n't , all you can do is determine if your af system ( camera and lens combination ) is off or not ( if it is off then you need to send them in for calibration , but if you have afmfa you can tweak it yourself ) . well done .
__label__positive__ wonderful set of binos . awesome clarity and very comfortable . the only criticism i have is that the rain covers ( ocular covers ) are very poorly designed . it is as if they were meant for some other model . nikon should do the right thing and include a proper set of rain covers for the eyepieces .
__label__positive__ one problem ... .there is no information to refill the pen ink when it runs out . now i have a pen that does not write anymore . thanks seller !
__label__positive__ neat gadget
__label__positive__ fast shipping and this is an overall excellent camera .
__label__positive__ outstanding !
__label__positive__ awesome backdrop , awesome company
__label__positive__ item arrived on time and works well . i have used it for sports photography and like it much better than the neck strap .
__label__negative__ if you are planning to use this ip camera day/night ( not the 2015 model ) with wifi and you happen to have a modern router then please do n't . after spending an hour trying different things i got to the following conclusion : < br / > . wired = works < br / > . wifi + security mode none = works ( but it is insecure so do not use this ) < br / > . wifi + security mode wep = fail . wep is no longer supported since it is high insecure < br / > . wifi + security mode wpa-psk / wpa2-psk = fail . no matter how you configure your router ( wpa2-psk [ aes ] , wpa-psk [ tkip ] + wpa2-psk [ aes ] or wpa/wpa2 enterprise ) < br / > < br / > there is a clear reason why this fails . this camera is from 2012 and technology has evolved a lot since then . updating to firmware version : 1.10 ( from 2015 ) does not fix any of these problems . this camera is version a1 . other problems that you will find is that the live video is using ancient technology that is no longer supported in modern browsers . the java viewer relies on npapi whose support has been removed in favor of ppapi . this means that your browser will not let you run the java viewer unless you configure it to run in insecure mode . the activex viewer does not work on mac so no luck there. < br / > < br / > in summary , do yourself a favor and buy a newer ip camera . wifi integration will work and hopefully live viewers too .
__label__positive__ i bought this to mount a video camera on my car 's roof. < br / > i 'm very pleased with it . the suction is very strong . even driving 90 km/h with side wind i felt confident that the mount would hold. < br / > the camera suffered some side vibrations , understandably , but less than i expected , and with a hand holding the camera it would produce very acceptable videos ( see https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ssojr1lwd0q - there 's no post-processing of the video except fades between cuts ) . < br / > be careful when mouting the camera so that the horizon is aligned. < br / > < br / > i also tried the mount extension , but did n't use it , yet . a bit difficult to assemble and would probably yield more vibration , so you 'll have to take your chances .
__label__positive__ they are realy good . easy to install , and work perfect .
__label__positive__ i bought 2 of these and have been using them for a while now . the picture quality is decent and the phone app works well . i originally had them set up via wifi but the pan/tilt function did not work that great from the app . i ran data cables to them and they work much better .
__label__positive__ this camera system is very easy to install and i have over a month no batteries issues . i use schedule for 7 days a week and mounted only to cover the key entrances without any extra traffic .

__label__positive__ i used these batteries for the first time this weekend , because i was going camping and had no electricity. < br / > they lasted as much as the original battery from my gopro , and the charger was also very efficient in recharging them and the other gopro batteries i have .
__label__positive__ hasnt scratched
__label__positive__ lens is great . cover arrived damaged , one of the latches was broken .
__label__positive__ i love it . very good .
__label__negative__ not very well made . would not allow proper seating of several bnc male connectors on cables and on rf attenuators . center pins were not even inside the insulation ( see picture ) . i was able to use only one out of the 10 units .
__label__negative__ it was suppose to be a great gift but ended up to be an embarrassment and a total waste of money . i 'm not even interested in refund cause this useless piece ruined the moment.if you are looking for a decorative telescope to impress your guests or just want to see what is going on a block from your house , you can definitely try the celestron 21061 . but if you work hard for your money beware , do n't buy . i 'm 100 % sure the positive reviews are fake . there is no way real customers would leave good feedbacks on this .
__label__positive__ this was a hit at my party . love it .
__label__negative__ pixdigital is not an approved nikon dealer ( called 3rd party by nikon ) . subsequently nikon will not honor their warranty on the camera .
__label__neutral__ it 's ok.but it is very difficult to judge distances when using it to help hitch up . the fish eye view is much too wide for that . better off buying the yellow ball hitch assist . basically two adjustable car antennas with yellow ball on each . one on trailer hitch and one on truck ball.line them up in rear view mirror . back up and when they touch you are there .
__label__neutral__ works okay . could be better
__label__positive__ excellent light meter ! i had initially searched for an & # 34 ; incident light meter & # 34 ; , and after checking reviews selected this one . i 'm in the process of replacing a lot of incandescent light bulbs with leds , and wanted to be able to compare the & # 34 ; before and after & # 34 ; illumination levels . this dr . meter lx1010b light meter is just what i needed ! < br / > < br / > i have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it 's a little annoying that the device essentially has to be held upside-down to read the display , but i 'm not down-rating it for that because otherwise it 's somewhat of a rarity : a device that is fully capable of performing its intended purpose ! ( that 's in contrast to things like windows 8 , apple family sharing , etc . )
__label__positive__ these are great little soft cases for lenses . i put these on and then throw them in my small bag for extra protection . it 's much better than just leaving them in the bag to get scuffed up . these are also a great price for all these cases .
__label__negative__ i purchases this item awhile back and simply regretted it when i when to put it on my dji phantom 3 professional . while they could be screwed into the corresponding area where these are intended for they do not line up correctly once everything is screwed in snugly . it will not be parallel with the unit and do to this i removed them swiftly . this seller in my opinion is scamming people saying this is a certified product intended for the phantom 3 because , in a way , it does almost fit the product as the phantom 2 which it is intended for but does not. < br / > < br / > please do not waste your money here and find a legitimate pair of guards for your $ 1,000.00+ dji machine . it is n't worth it in the long run and can lead to you damaging your product while in the air .
__label__positive__ outstanding product and capabilities < br / > awesome color
__label__negative__ do not waste your money on this peace of crap . if you never used telescope than you can get the same result for twice or triple less money and get more pleasure from it : 1 ) it may sound illogical but there are no much difference between 50 , 150 , 300 or even 900 magnification . the most optimal is 50 and in some case you may use 150 ( only for moon or mountains ) . 2 ) the tripod is terrible ... if you use 300 or 900 magnification , moon stays in front of eye for 8-15 seconds . to keep it in center you need to use special slow motion wheels works terrible for two reasons : it shakes like with earthquake and motion to one direction is extremely tight despite my telescope was perfectly balanced 3 ) you can see no stars ... all those photos mentioned in reviews are fake or from manufacturer . i could hardly manage to get start in center of my telescope ( thanks to an hour spent adjusting finderscope perfectly , which actually is worse in quality than any kind binoculars ) and all i saw was a dot ... i tried 900 magnification , the star stayed in center no more than 5 sec or less and all i saw the same black surface with single tinny dot . 4 ) barlow lens is 3x while 2x would be better option ( another attempt to force you make another purchase ) . 5 ) you can not see milky way or anything like that ... you need perfect condition : country side without street lights in 5km radius , preferably high mountain and not just clean sky but also extra dry air ... i am sure you have seen night sky with lots of stars , that 's the night you are looking for ( it 's very rare ) . 6 ) telescope is extremely heavy , over 13kg and a bit complicated to assemble and disassemble every day ... my solution : i bought it for my dad and it was wasting of money and lots of frustration of my dad . he get bored after couple of days watching moon . i will not give up , i will follow pro 's advice and buy smaller telescope with 50-100 magnification , no more than 2-3kg and 900mm aperture . the price will be around 50-60 usd ! it does notrequire assembling , it could be used day time and it 's easy to carry with you when you go hiking . i hope my post will save your money ; )
__label__positive__ perfect , performs the same as the old one .
__label__positive__ good camera
__label__positive__ i am very pleased with the quality of this kit and the reasonable price . the advertising and photos of the product are also very accurate . i will be using the lenses with a motorola droid turbo , and so far the test shots look very good . it is a well designed system which is adaptable to cell phones of various sizes . the clamp/tripod adapter is fairly strong , although it is not a great fit for my droid while it has a protective shell attached . i will probably need to take my phone out of the shell accessory in order to use the clamp and lens holder system with confidence that it will not fall out when the camera is being panned or otherwise moved . all in all , i highly recommend the universal smart phone camera lens kit .
__label__positive__ this is what you want ! ! ! dont try and get some knock off one from another company ! you can trust this mount with your camera , you definitely ca n't say that about the other suction cup mounts ! vibration is at a minimum with this thing and i can always angle it the way i need it ! ya it might be more than the other mounts , but its because this product works very well . i can see the difference in film quality when i use the knock off mounts . save the money and get this one !
__label__positive__ love this thing . i can see my dogs behavior while we are gone , and it provides an extra bit of home security as well . make sure you do n't plug it in too near a cell phone as it can interfere with the wifi signal !
__label__positive__ satisfaction
__label__positive__ works great on my nikon d700 dlsr , easier to be included in family photos when using a tripod , or to avoid moving the camera when taking macro or long exposure photos ... .much better price than..ahem ... nikon oem device .
__label__positive__ great product
__label__negative__ bad quality , get the original of you are going to get this one
__label__positive__ better than buying more filters .
__label__positive__ wow ... what a huge improvement this made in my white balance under tricky lighting situations . if used as directed ( that 's the important part ) , you 'll nail white balance every time . you have to remember to set white balance by aiming toward the light source , otherwise you 'll end up with weird results . only thing i would change is the price- it 's a little steep for all-plastic construction . it does come with a nice rubber case , though .
__label__positive__ absolutely love this device ! it 's great for taking video and photos in all conditions .
__label__positive__ i have a couple of laptops used by my kids for their studies which reached the point where they needed new batteries . well , checking the prices led me to wonder if there was n't an external battery that could be used like the little ones everyone has for their smartphones . my research led me to the ravpower and so far i have not been disappointed at all . for a little bit more than the price of one laptop 's battery we now have a universal battery for a variety of devices . we now have extra power for our old laptops , tablets and phones . the only thing left to determine is the longevity of the battery pack itself , since i 've only had it for a few weeks . fit and finish is very good .
__label__positive__ all is ok . thanks !
__label__positive__ this monopod from slik offers just what i was looking for : a very light mono pod that also collapses very short while extending tall when you need it , and has that important pivoting ball head top mount . so , i guess you can say this one has it all , at least for my own purposes . it 's light enough that it does n't get in the way when you are trying to shoot , and the fact that it collapses so short really helps when it comes to packing it away or even dangling it off a bag or belt . the quality , like most slik products , is very good . the latches open and close with definitive precision , the legs expand out almost effortlessly , and the latches close right back up with little effort . the finish is nice , too , making it look nice without drawing to much attention to itself . it 's a great camera accessory for those times when you need a little bit of extra stability but can not ( or do n't want to ) fool around with a tripod . five stars .
__label__positive__ arrived on time . exactly as expected .
__label__positive__ excelentt , very good
__label__positive__ very simple setup with my iphone and home network . works great , can access while out and away live or recorded . motion detection works well so far , wide angle view gives great coverage . can not zoom in when looking at recorded to sd card video remotely though . im am very happy and have bought a second camera . many complain that events to google is broken but i do n't use that feature as i have motion sectors , open/close sensors , apple lights , water/moisture sensors , etc working through smart things hub so i know when any one is moving through the house and exactly where they are with notifications to my iphone , now i have the video too ! love that i do n't have to pay for cloud service , use sd card in unit . eventually will try to stream to recorder . love talking to my parrot to !
__label__positive__ just right size for my new dd ar15 556 super light weight short barrel
__label__positive__ i just used this tonight out of the box , great product ! my customers would comment your picture quality is nothing like your product ... it looks so much better in person . the last straw was when a customer order a black & gold pen and it was really purple & gold . niw , my pictures match the quality if my products . thank you
__label__positive__ great photos of portraits and low-light !
__label__positive__ very beautiful bag
__label__positive__ it is great . savesthe expense of purchasing an expensive hot shoe flash . only problem i have to use a piece of cheese cloth as an diff user at times . on full power , it can be a little to much giving your subject that washed out look . especially if you are fairly close . the cheese cloth and a rubber band , takes away a lot of-the brightness when using up close . really like it . highly recommend especially using for long lenses . it gets out there .
__label__positive__ super a+
__label__positive__ product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery ! ! ! will be back to this sellers page ! ! !
__label__positive__ for once a product is better than advertised ! it 's not 1.6 ounces , it 's actually 1.25 ounces ! it comes with great accessories to be able to mounted anywhere imaginable . it records high-definition . great product ! < br / > < br / > i must also add that the accessories come with a very innovative way of holding the camera . there 's a strap that can tightened using tracks on the strap as you rotate a ring . i 've never seen this design before , but it 's very clever .
__label__positive__ great quality , nothing else like it on the market
__label__positive__ this thing is so small and does a wonderful job for its price . i just love it . fact that it 's so small , i 'm always scared if i 'm gon na lose this little thing one day .
__label__neutral__ it 's worth what i paid for it .
__label__positive__ i love this thing ! first i bought this like a year ago for my iphone , it fit pretty well but the holder was pretty annoying and it broke pretty fast : d but then i bought a real camera ! eventually i realized i can screw the stand into my camera and that 's how i 've been using it for about 6 months . it 's amazing how i can position the camera however i want , get the perfect angle because of the flexibility of the stand and joints , and even hang it off of things ! it 's absolutely useful and helps me make some amazing pictures !
__label__positive__ i absolutely love this camera ! ! ! the only complaint i have is how still you have to have it when it is fully zoomed but i figure that 's because it has such a far zoom . i did n't like the camera bag that it came with so i bought the canon deluxe gadget bag 100eg and it works great . love all of the other extra 's it came with and so far have not had a problem . having fun with the camera and the amazing zoom i have gotten to take pictures with this that i never would have imagined taking before . it does so many things that i 'm still trying to figure out but it is fun learning . i would absolutely buy this again
__label__positive__ perfect for hiking
__label__positive__ 👍🏼
__label__positive__ product is great , but deliver took over 2 weeks to get to me .
__label__positive__ received quickly , all parts and items were accounted for and in condition indicated . great set of accessories at a great price !
__label__negative__ this item does not float and started to rust after a week , which is surprising for an item sold by a dive store . i guess you get what you pay for .
__label__positive__ was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it ... she used to have the same one that her son drop by mistake inside the water ... . it became a perfect gift for her : )
__label__positive__ works great !
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ great product !
__label__positive__ easy to use and great quality recording , would definitely recommend
__label__negative__ the connection and the stick was broken after a short period of usage !
__label__positive__ camera is absolutely adorable . recommend to buy with bacpac )
__label__positive__ good quality .
__label__positive__ f o r my wife she loves it
__label__negative__ it was the second one i ordered and neither of the two would read the smart card when inserted. < br / > < br / > john adair
__label__negative__ takes practice but still hard to use . must view it on hard steady surfaces ( holding in hand is too shaky ) . also , everything you see is inverted .
__label__positive__ purchased two of these , used one for two years or so , one for a month . not what you 'd call heavy duty equipment , but more than adequate for my purposes and budget . does what is should , i 'd recommend it for small , back yard flocks . it 's raised by a string on a winding mechanism , so i 'd also suggest being very careful with the door / track / winding pulley alignment , and maybe a protective cover over the area the door slides up into , to protect the string .
__label__positive__ this is a quality product that is built well and designed to be easily balanced , and then to maintain that balance . the rubber grip adhesive on the lower arm is a key component in keeping the weights from rotating while moving the steadicam around . i bought it for my personal use as a hobbyist photographer , i just got a gopro earlier this month , and plan to use that and my dslr to start adventuring into video . finding a steadicam that was reasonably priced and could handle both the light weight of the gopro and my dslr was important in my decision making . once i become more comfortable with the steadicam , i may start using it to generate some sort promotional footage for the apartment communities that i work at . i have enjoyed getting to play around with the roxant steadicam a little over the weekend . i was able to balance my gopro on it fairly easily and ended up with some fun , smooth footage . hopefully this weekend i will be able to figure out the balance for my dslr and get to try that some as well as shoot some more with the gopro .
__label__positive__ too much stuff and not enough time to use it .
__label__positive__ i love the device . only wish is that it sat high enough when facing myself from a low angle that the hardware was not visible in shot .
__label__positive__ worked perfectly . car charger is an added bonus ! !
__label__positive__ i was on the fence for quite a while on buying this , their other , hard-backed model , or something off of ebay . ebay : the ebay ones are about $ 50~ % 80 and seem pretty crappy . they 're not exact knock-offs of the other koozam , as they do n't have external pockets . they 're basically just a rectangle zipper with straps . also , since it 's ebay , there 's no real reviews . koozam hard-cover : the other two main models for koozam are $ 180 to $ 200 . that 's a huge price jump for basically a backpack . also some of the reviews showed that the dji p3 does n't quite fit -- or that it does fit , but the motor mounts stick up far too high to be protected . i have a trip coming up and i do n't want to get caught between trying to ship something back and all that . the dji bags ( both soft and hard ) are way too expensive ( $ 250-300 ) ( and heavy ) to consider . with batteries costing $ 150- $ 180 , i 've got to save up . lastly , i saw this koozam soft backpack . it has no review ( as of today ) , but it 's clearly a new model . the price is n't horrible . so i took a chance . 1 ) it arrived in 3 days . i live in maryland . no idea where it shipped from , but it beat the amazon expectations . 2 ) it 's still squarish , but it 's soft . 3 ) tons of pockets . room for everything you could want . properly lined and well sewed . 4 ) comes with rainfly 5 ) zippers are n't ykk , but look like good quality . main zipper is large . the rest are normal sized . 6 ) foam is nicely cut . dual toned ( blue on top ) . glued to the outer 'box ' frame . it pulls off if you force it , so do n't . might be a wear issue later . 7 ) fits the dji p3 perfectly ! motor mounts are flush with the top of the foam . arms are snug against the x carved out for them . you 'll need a gimble lock to keep it from flopping around . the top flap has a little padding , but also has pockets which provide ample padding . this is not a check-in bag , of course . 8 ) straps are .. well , straps . not great , not horrible . there are , though , chest straps as well as a lumbar strap . they both adjust . my only other comment is that the backpack , with the dji in there , tablet , charger , etc , is so light it does n't quite need them . it 's crazy light . it 's a great backpack . but no , it is not quite worth $ 170 . none of them are . not the dji one , not the hard case ones . if you ignore that , it 's a great bag . update 7/13/2015 : i 've used the bag a couple of times on light excursions . again , fits the dji p3 perfectly -- it was clearly cut for it . the front bottom zippered pocket has an inset pocket that fits my 8 & # 34 ; tablet perfectly and is probably designed for an ipad . there 's another section inside the case where a tablet might fit , but i think that would be for a larger , 9 or 10 & # 34 ; , as mine flops around there . i recently bought the snap-on/off prop guards . when i received them i realized that installing the guard 's mating base part would alter the silhouette of the dji 's arms . since this case is perfectly cut for the original outline of the dji p3 , installing the guards would mean i have to cut the foam of this case . koozam , if you 're reading this : offer another slightly modified case that has a 1/4 & # 34 ; recess around the tips of the arms . the shaft of the arm can remain tight , but where the motors are needs to be bumped out and down 1/4 & # 34 ; . also : reduce the price . this is too expensive . still 4 stars .
__label__positive__ good buy for the price ... it works just as well as my $ 180 bushnell hd legend monocular . the single finger adjustment is great and easy to use . looking forward to trying it out in colorado next week in the mountains .
__label__positive__ great and strud for a dslr , but the knobs/caps get loose over time .
__label__positive__ it fits perfectly well on our nikkor 18-55mm lens .
__label__positive__ item received as described .
__label__positive__ this is something you will find indispensable when you use it . you just photograph it in the ambient light you 're using , and then when you get to post processing , line up all your photos from that session and use this as a white balance reference . it 's amazing when you see all of your pictures come into perfect balance. < br / > also , their website has a whole lot of useful tools and information .
__label__positive__ great product ! i 've got this many times and is worth the buy !
__label__positive__ great caps and i especially love the wrist strings that help me not to lose them !
__label__positive__ great set , had almost all the bells and whistles in one kit , more than enough for a starter set with the go-pro .
__label__positive__ thourghly enjoing this lense
__label__positive__ this product is just what i needed . i will be ordered more soon . i ca n't get these here in georgia any more . please keep them in stock and coming
__label__positive__ i like this tool ... .glad to see that this cardboard technology is still used..
__label__negative__ the soloshot 2 is a really cool treat for surfers and motocross riders . there are a few other activities that this would be valuable for however i made the mistake of buying without reading through all of the text . the biggest problem with this device is that it is gps based , which means if you are outdoors and at a distance it is great , however if you are indoors or within 10 feet it becomes a very expensive tripod riser. < br / > < br / > ultimately i ended up returning it because i could not justify the cost for my personal use .
__label__positive__ takes awesome pictures and very vivid color . could not get the streaming to work but that is a bit over kill anyway .
__label__positive__ works perfect i could not complain at all
__label__positive__ all fine , works like the original , no complains .
__label__negative__ good concept , but it did not come close to meeting my need . the marketing information indicates that the promaster has the capacity to charge up to five times . with a nikon dslr battery ( kind of pictured in the image ) , i got only one charge before depleting the promaster 's internal battery . on a second attempt , i charge a gopro battery and a panasonic lumix l-1000 . yes , 1 or 2 charges is & # 34 ; up to five & # 34 ; , but the cost of additional spare batteries is a less expensive alternative .
__label__positive__ tldr : light , collapsible when empty , expandable to hold lots of gear. < br / > < br / > two minor downsides : < br / > 1 ) i have is that when i do n't put much in it , it tends to flop about , but i wanted a light , collapsible camera/laptop bag , and this has served its purpose well over the past few months. < br / > 2 ) no velcro silencer . i just taped over them so it 's quieter to access , albeit slightly less secure. < br / > < br / > gear it holds inside : < br / > 1x full frame dslr ( e.g. , d810 ) < br / > 3-4 good sized lenses ( e.g. , 24-70 f2.8 , 80-200 f2.8 , 16-35 f4 , 70-300 ) < br / > 2 small primes ( e.g. , 35 f1.8 dx , 50 f1.4 ) < br / > note : can only fit the 80-200 mounted on the body if it 's put sideways in the bag . to my knowledge , the newer 70-200 is a similar size. < br / > < br / > or < br / > 2x full frame dslr < br / > 3 good sized lenses < br / > < br / > in addition to the above , it fits papers , a 10-11inch tablet ( ie , ipad ) , a 15 inch laptop , all relevant cables , cards , accessories distributed throughout < br / > < br / > and < br / > < br / > 2x water bottles or flashes in the outside pockets . if you 're ballsy , they 'll hold your lenses too. < br / > < br / > gets kind of bulky and messy if it 's stuffed full of all of the above , but it 's comforting to me to know i can do it if needed .
__label__positive__ i got this lowepro backpack for a trip i was having . i like to take my photo gear with me when traveling , i carry my canon d6 with a mounted 150-600 sigma lens ( it 's big and heavy ) plus a couple of different lenses , some sd cards , a tripod , some cleaning stuff etc . so far i 'm very happy with it it 's very spacious , more so than it looks , the straps are very comfortable . seems durable too , but time will tell . i can recommended to anybody who needs a big backpack .
__label__positive__ i was a bit disappointed to discover that i purchased the wrong camera . i spent so much time researching cameras and getting recommendations ! i did n't realize that when i searched for one model another one showed up . i 've played with the camera for a week and was happy to discover that for my purposes ( very general ) it did n't matter . i 'm extremely happy with the camera . it 's my first dslr . i 'm almost overwhelmed with the amount of features , but it 's wonderful . i 'm excited to learn photography and what i can do . even the & # 34 ; auto & # 34 ; settings are producing great photographs .
__label__negative__ i would n't call this kit & # 34 ; professional & # 34 ; by any stretch of the imagination . the brushes are poor quality , the bulb does n't give a strong enough blast of air to do much of anything , and the spray bottle is empty . i did n't use the lens papers because they felt too rough . the only thing worth having in the kit were the microfiber cloths and i get those for free with almost every camera accessory that i 've ever bought , so i would n't waste my money on this kit again .
__label__positive__ 1 aug : 2015 : sunday : ex/cust/serv ! thxu : a great bargain $ $ $ $ $ $ price ! best/wishes charles .
__label__positive__ i wanted this camera so badly and was so excited when my husband agreed to get it for me for a mother 's day gift . this has been my first foray into dslr photography . i have enjoyed my canon powershot elph 310 point and shoot for several years and had confidence that this would be a great product . i have not been able to explore all the features yet , but am working on improving at shooting in manual mode . i find the camera to be easy and intuitive to use . the images are crisp and clear . i have not used everything that came in the bundle yet , but have used the two main lenses , the bag , and the tripod . i found the tripod to be sturdy enough . i like that it has a wide range of heights at which it can be set . the bag holds everything in the bundle ( except for the tripod ) and some additional items that i purchased separately . i take mostly photos of my kids and some flowers/nature shots . it is taking me some time to get used to the limitations of the lenses as i am used to my point and shoot being able to take good macro shots and being able to zoom super far , but it 's just a matter of adjusting . i can not write a super technical review since i am really still learning , but i would definitely definitely buy this camera again . focus camera was awesome . they did not include two items in my bundle that were on the list , but seemed to substitute with different items . one of the items that was not included was the wrist strap , which i really wanted . also , just days after i purchased this , the price changed . i contacted focus camera through amazon and they gave me half of the price difference and quickly sent out the two items that were missing . the customer service was excellent . i am ordering another lens and searched to find if it was available through focus and am purchasing it from them ( through amazon ) because of their outstanding customer service .
__label__positive__ love this ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ i live in an apartment . and needed a camera across the lane and wires were n't an option i 'm tech illiterate but works fine and batteries last forever ! wish it had audio .
__label__positive__ love this case . i accidentally left it outside in the rain for 3 days . my lawncare guy spotted it in the grass after nearly mowing it over with the law mower , and kicked it up onto the patio . i went out and grabbed it , took it inside and rinsed the dirt and wet grass off of it , opened it up , and all my cards were safe and sound - and completely dry . a little moisture got in the hinges , but none got through the rubber seams . # win
__label__positive__ great camera , i bought it for my sister and she loved it
__label__positive__ very satisfied .
__label__positive__ wonderful
__label__positive__ fun camera ! !
__label__neutral__ i am on my 5th nikon coolpix camera , all have been different coolpix models . they work great until the battery door malfunctions . my last nikon battery door broke today , it is the last nikon i buy . for the last 5 years i have replaced the broken one with a new coolpix model so i did not have to re learn how to use all of the buttons . i use my camera almost daily , usually 10 to 20 pics , then down load to my computer every day . it was a great camera as was the others , but the battery door is a malfunction waiting to happen .
__label__positive__ amazing filter , i can get much better colour and contrast in my shot than with out it and whith no loss in iq and of course with no reflections . it also has frontal thread so i can put my filter holder to use with gnd 's
__label__positive__ great construction . sturdy and well made
__label__positive__ takes good pictures
__label__negative__ did n't do much for me . i have small hands and i could barely reach around the whole thing . does not come with the attachable arm strap . would not recommend it .
__label__positive__ great investment and i love it so much and here are some pic that i took for my sony a6000 .
__label__positive__ nice case , fit everything i wanted to take on my trip , even fit my d5300 with extended battery module attached , well made with molded bottom protection
__label__negative__ i had to return it . bad flash & one of the batteries were also bad . it was after 30 days & amazon would not accept my return ! ! !
__label__positive__ my daughter loves it . so compact and pics are amazing !
__label__positive__ this is a review for the sgc-698 version . why this entry is merged with the inferior sgc-598 , i do n't understand ... the sgc-698 is a decent stereo condeser shotgun mic fo a dslr , with a few shortcomings for the price . nice metal construction on the mic and electronics , unfortunately the base which connects to the flash shoe is plastic and does n't appear quite as well made as the core mic part . i ca n't fathom why the manufacturer does n't include one cr2032 battery since there is a molded space for the battery in the nice product box ! our usual pros/cons , first the pros : + nicely constructed metal core mic section of the product + good stereo response left and right with slight loss of gain straight ahead of mic + when used at -10db setting , the mic has an ok noise floor + package includes nice cardboard storage box + package includes & # 34 ; foxtail & # 34 ; style wind screen and storage bag + good balance when in flash shoe and the cons : - adding any pre-amp gain ( 0 db or +20db ) on the mic introduces significantly more noise than -10db - base that includes flash shoe connection is plastic and less well made than mic - plastic base is threaded , but not for 1/4-20 tripod thread ( and i would n't use it ! ) - choice of cr-2032 means no rechargeable battery option - no batteries included ( though box has a molded space for it ) - the foxtail windscreen is very difficult to put on the mic actually , the sgc-698 with the addition of a hot shoe to tripod mount adapter is usable in a pinch as an interview mic . i 've done so with a tascam dr-60d digital recorder .
__label__negative__ camera does not work and phone app does not recgnize camera . two thumbs down ! ! !
__label__positive__ oh my god , this was an absolutely best buy in my life since ever . i do not regret any minute for buying this awesome gopro camera , i can not live without it anymore . its like an addiction . when i travel , every time is going with me , for every occasion must need around myself . recommend to everyone who loves adrenaline sports and traveling , this is a must need camera !
__label__negative__ stopped working after 3 days .
__label__positive__ i just recently purchased these cameras after reading some of the previous reviews . i to agree that they serve its purpose . the cameras offer sound that you can turn on or off from your phone . the picture is very clear also . the cameras switch from color to black and white constantly but i 'm satisfied with this product . i also agree that the initial set up was quite difficult . i contacted the support helpline and spoke to greg- customer service rep id # ar-004215 , he was awesome , very knowledgeable , patient and walked me through step by step . this type of customer service insured me that i made the right purchase . i wish greg worked at every store in which i had to deal with a customer service representative .
__label__positive__ worked just like i expected .
__label__positive__ sturdy , lightweight and easy to tighten . could n't believe how light it is , compared to my old one .
__label__positive__ this little cheap camera worked perfectly ! i mean the software could be updated a little more , but other than that it was awesome . the videos look a little darker than a gopro 's , but for the price it is amazing . it comes with so many mounts and cases ! i was expecting to have to buy a lot of things , but it came with many of them . it did not come with the back that would make it float , or a selfie stick , but i did n't expect it to come with anything . for the price you ca n't beat it .
__label__positive__ what can i say . this table tripod is so sturdy it can hold my canon 70d with a canon 70-200 2.8 is ii with the tripod attached to the lens . this tripod is always in my camera bag and very helpful when in the field .
__label__positive__ fast shipping , nice flash , awesome speed light .
__label__neutral__ purchased this touchscreen as part of the gopro package . my husband uses the go pro . we discovered that using the lcd during filming takes up a lot of battery life . perhaps it is good to use as a beginner . it will give you an idea of how you are filming overall . we plan on not using it when we are doing activities .
__label__positive__ this head strap works well , the price is reasonable .
__label__positive__ just right for a micro four thirds camera , a couple of lenses and a few accessories .
__label__negative__ no comments
__label__positive__ great product at an unbelievable price . did side by side , underwater comparison with grandson 's gopro . $ 500 gopro was only slightly , just barely , better than anart . unless you 're shooting for professional , production level distribution , do n't waste money on big brand name . anart is a great product .
__label__negative__ do n't waste your time on this piece of crap ! refurbished and upgraded i think not ! but if you enjoy wasting your time on something that is not going to work , then ladies and gentleman , here is what you have always dreamed about ! this piece of garbage will even have you wanting to leave your finger prints on someone 's throut ! ! ! do n't waste your time buying , look elsewhere and save yourself from a big headache ! samsung makes nice phones but their cameras leave a lot to be desired ! ! ! ! ! !
__label__negative__ if i could give this product zero stars i would ! i bought this because i am going to be filming a documentary soon and need an undercover camera . i tested it out in my very well lit apartment and found some severe problems with it : < br / > 1 ) not 1080p hd like advertised . in fact it is some of the worst footage i have ever seen and leaves a time code on the bottom of the footage. < br / > 2 ) micro sd card not accessible unless you cut away at the taped up wires. < br / > 3 ) on that note , micro sd card was only 4gb ... not 8 like advertised . lies left and right. < br / > 4 ) audio is terrible ! < br / > 5 ) usb connector does n't read my computer ( windows 10 ) so i had to cut out the micro sd and use an sd adapter to even look at the footage. < br / > 6 ) hat is pretty small and barely fits my head ... it also stick up a ton so it constantly feels like it 's going to fall off. < br / > 7 ) last and perhaps the worst issue of all , when i walked around looking at targets to see how the camera aligned with my eyes line of sight , not only did the camera not record what i was looking at , but it was pointed nearly up to the ceiling ! the only way to record exactly what you want to film is to basically stare at your feet the whole time. < br / > < br / > without a doubt this is probably the worst spy/covert/hidden camera i have ever seen . i bought a $ 30 pair of hidden camera glasses that worked 10 times better than this in every way possible ! i could probably deal with the bad video quality on this product if i had to ... but there are just way too many things wrong with this . i can not emphasize this enough ... .do not buy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ is what it says it is , and works just fine .
__label__positive__ works filne
__label__positive__ love love love them . ordered two to monitor my pups when i 'm away.i do n't fully understand how all the features work yet but they do a great job . i 'm no expert on resolution but they look great to me , i do n't even use the highest setting . i have one mounted under my deck out of the weather and it monitors my driveway , its about 35 ft from my router and beyond two doors and works perfect .
__label__positive__ aside from it being difficult to snap into place , and not allowing my p3 to fit in my hprc case because the landing legs do n't have a slight give to insert snugly , this gimbal guard is great . ***when i power up my p3 and the gimbal does its motion checks , there is a slight knocking on the very far end of the roll adjustment . does n't hurt anything , but could have been built better to avoid this .
__label__positive__ got this as a b-day gift for my hubby who is into drifting . he loves it ! mount stays secure when driving at high speeds !
__label__neutral__ good strap , but has a tendency to want to twist around & the placed side ended up facing out .
__label__neutral__ not a factory battery . that said , it still works . but when i bought it , it was advertised as being factory .
__label__positive__ got the kit fast the batteries and charger are vivtar , and i have never had any issues with vivitar in the past , the batteries are marked el 14a i charged them up 1 using the vivitar charger and 1 using the nikon charger , they both took about the same time , and the batteries seem to work fine . the small tripod that comes with the kit is cute , but i would not put a $ 1200 camera on it , it works great for the small point and shoot , and the small camcorders . the ac adapter is a real plus , plug it into the power supply ( cigarette lighter ) and charge the batteries on the go anywhere . the cleaning kit is just that , cleaning solution , q-tips and lens cloth , it will do the job .
__label__positive__ it does work good .
__label__positive__ i had originally purchased a poloroid instax and was so disappointed with the quality that i switched to using my iphone and this printer which i have to say is awesome ! the images are vivid and full bleed , no regrets and totally worth it .
__label__negative__ fuzzy and you ca n't see what in the world is even going on . seriously , buy a dropcam and do n't waste your money on this junk !
__label__positive__ i received a sample at a discount for an evaluation and honest review. < br / > < br / > as my title states , these are quality microfiber cloths and have worked great on my glasses , computer monitor screens , and on my tv screen . the edges have n't frayed at all on me ( but admittedly i 've only been using them for a couple of weeks ) , and the fabric is holding up just great. < br / > < br / > qkoo sells multiple versions of these clothes in different colors , sizes , and number of cloths per pack . so , you might want to search on amazon to see which package fits your needs better . i prefer the smaller cloths for my glasses , but their biggest cloth for my tv screen. < br / > < br / > at first , i thought it was a bit wasteful for these to come individually packaged ( each cloth is in its own nice wrapper with instructions ) , but after thinking about it , i quite like it . after all , i do n't use a bunch of these all at once , and their packaging lets me easily put the rest in a drawer and keep them clean for when i do want them. < br / > < br / > these are n't abnormal or special in the world of microfiber cloths , but i was n't looking for that . i wanted quality cloths that work , and these fit the bill . i will say that i slightly prefer the feel of the only branded microfiber cloths that i 've used , but the potential downside to those is that the colors are random ( at least in the pack that i got ) and pretty flashy ( like bright yellow and pink ) . these are as pictured and pretty subdued in color if that 's what you like. < br / > < br / > if the price is right when you 're shopping , i definitely recommend these . nicely made , work great , and ( at least at the moment ) fairly priced .
__label__negative__ this is one of the few purchases i have ever sent back to amazon.com . the material was & # 34 ; torn and zipper did n't work & # 34 ; . i will not recommend this product .
__label__negative__ i 'm really frustrated at how fragile these batteries are . both my friend and i own dji quadcopters , and have both had batteries fail . i have probably flown my phantom only 20 times over 2 years because it has had so many issues . today it fell out of the sky due to a swelled battery . so there goes another hundred dollars- thankful that i was n't flying over the water ! ! ! i 'd sell my phantom if i could but i can not sell something that works so poorly to someone and feel ok about that .
__label__positive__ one of the best purchases i have made through amazon ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ i always get these batteries for my kodak camera , they are great .
__label__positive__ excellent product everything i was hoping for . great seller , easy transaction .
__label__positive__ i have to say overall i really like these little camera 's . there are a few things you should know that i do n't think are spelled out in any of the reviews i read before buying. < br / > 1 . they use an antenna that has to connect to your router and then repeated the signal to the cameras . this has the advantage of making hookup easy , because the system just finds the internet connection and the the cameras and you are ready to go.the down side is do n't think the cameras will work anywhere you have a good signal in your home . i have multiple repeaters , but the cameras only wants to receive and send to that one antenna . this may not be a problem if you are only planning on putting them within 100ft of your router . i think you could buy another antenna and separate the two if you have a big home. < br / > 2 . they picture quality is very good , comparable to my hardwire cams. < br / > 3 . they are easily moved around , so you can constantly switch where you want monitored. < br / > 4 . the app is very intuitive , but basic . for example you can turn motion detection on or off , but you ca n't pick out a specific trigger point . they make you adjust sensitivity instead . this is odd , because a specific pixel area is a much more accurate detection method . i have a feeling it is because unit is always resting until it is triggered.monitoring a pixel would kill the battery sooner. < br / > < br / > 5 . trigger time . it takes a second to start a trigger , so you need to think about how to position camera to get an action shot.if you are to close and perpendicular to the subject , tenth camera is likely to record after the subject crosses the path . i have on at my front door and it frequently issues people who exit to fast. < br / > 6 . this is a fun camera to use around the house or work , but because of the detection issues , i would not recommend it for important security installations.with that being said , i am sure they can fix that in the future , and that is why i gave them 4/5 stars. < br / > for the money , a good buy ! y !
__label__positive__ i got this sample at substantial discount in exchange for my review . this is the best deal on the best quality microfiber cloths i have ever seen -- you think these are all the same -- and mostly they are -- but there are some differences . most microfiber cloths are about 4x5 & # 34 ; . just enough to rub on a lens , or clean a pair of glasses . these are almost 2x that size , 7x8 and are all individually wrapped . they are very soft , very clean ( each one wrapped ) and perfect -- you get 8 per package , one for glovebox , desk , tool box , pocket , purse , suitcase , and so on . if you normally use tissues to clean your glasses ( or shirt tail ) you will be amazed at how much cleaner and without scratching -- these will make them . plus you can use these on expensive optics -- coated -- -like camera lenses , microscopes , binoculars , telescopes , and anything similar . you can use these to polish silver , crystal , or to just have for whatever -- -- they are very handy and at this price , are affordable and once you use them , they become a & # 34 ; must have & # 34 ; . you will wonder how you survived without them .
__label__neutral__ worthwhile if you find a bargain . batteries hold up well . motion sensors delay causes people to be out of the frame before recording . about a 1-2 sec delay . numerous false alarms and yet has hard time recognizing people in vicinity .
__label__positive__ good video quality both day and night . needed tech support 2 times and both times were excellent in helping me get it set up . yes it is big , yes the wires are a pain to deal with they should have ports in the back of the camera instead of wires , that way if you dont use them they wont be there . the mount is limited to only 1 mounting position so i could not mount it under the eave of my roof and had to mount it to a wall portion of the house . power supply cable is short and you will need to buy an extension power cord from amazon . its only been up and working for a week . software to run the setup , viewing and play back is ok. no pan or tilt and zoom is only in and out once each way . playback is limited to only real time and pause , no fast forward or slow motion . good camera for the price ,
__label__positive__ excelente cámara ..delivery rapido
__label__positive__ the thumb grip makes the x100t much easier to handle and more stable when taking pictures . it fits tightly with no screws to tighten or mar the camera finish . the only downsides are that it takes up the hot shoe and sits right above the rear wheel . it does n't block it , but it is snug . and it is easy to remove to mount a flash . in my view it significantly improves the cameras ergonomics .
__label__positive__ love . i am still learning some of the features for this is my first nice camera outside of pocket digital cameras .
__label__positive__ it does exactly what it is supposed to do .
__label__positive__ great
__label__neutral__ i have not been extremely happy with this mic . mostly because of the quality to price factor . i have a few sennheiser lapels that come with the g3 kit and i feel they are very comparable in quality . i have been using both mics in the field and i almost prefer the sennheiser ( $ 150 ) compared to the ( $ 350 ) countryman .
__label__positive__ so fat so good
__label__positive__ it works alright . little bulky.. not as much room as indicated by pictures and other user reviews . decent for a casual day of shooting , but does n't hold all i 'd like it after reading the reviews
__label__positive__ is a great price for this camera
__label__positive__ i have been saving up for this product for a while . when i first got it i was terrified that it might fly away and i would never get the money back . after the 1 hour battery charge and the 20 second calibration process i was ready to fly ; i pushed the to joysticks into the start position , and life sprung through the drone . its idle position is remarkably silent compared to other drones i have flown . i slowly but surely throttled it up using the left joystick , and it quickly jumped into the air , now that first fear i had seems like an impossibility . the pros and cons of this aircraft include : < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > < br / > remarkably smooth flight , < br / > very advanced gps mode , < br / > easy to fly for beginners and more advanced settings for pros , < br / > sleek design , < br / > easy to spot led 's in the dark , < br / > long battery life ( compared to other drones and its predecessor the phantom 1 ) < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > < br / > expensive replacement battery < br / > < br / > as you can see the pros greatly outweigh the cons , and that is why i think this drone is a remarkable quadrotor for beginners and pro cinematographers alike . for the price i highly recommend this drone.bbecause of the helicopters huge popularity , there is also a wide variety of customizations you can perform to it to raise its performance or to just make it look cool .
__label__negative__ product arrived deffective , with one loose leg , like there is a missing screw or something . i needed it for my vacations , what a waste of time and money .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ a little disappointed to see plastic mounting hardware .
__label__positive__ works flawlessly
__label__positive__ great deal ! works great ! !
__label__positive__ i got this screen protector last week . it fits the screen of my d40 perfectly . i can see the image clearly . it only has adhesive on the outside border ( black area ) . it came very well packed and with clear mounting instructions. < br / > < br / > i have n't had it long enough to say how easily it scratches , but i 'm very happy with the way it looks on my camera . i had a film protector before , but this glassy one looks much better .
__label__positive__ basic as it gets but it gets the job done without hurting the wallet .
__label__positive__ this does exactly what it is supposed to do , it allows me to use my 77mm filters on a lens that uses 67mm filters and saves me hundreds of dollars buying new filters . the filters screwed onto the adapter with ease and then screwed into the lens threads with no problems also . i could have spent $ 20-30 dollars more for another adapter , but why ?
__label__positive__ great light , very portable . love the ability to dim the light also .
__label__positive__ very pleased with these . the light with a speedlight wad great .
__label__positive__ excellent
__label__positive__ great point and shoot for the price . this thing uploads photos wirelessly ! let me say that again . you can take photos and they go right to your computer , iphone , or facebook . it 's so easy it 's almost scary . be careful what you snap and upload . ha ! i use this for vacations or field trips where i do n't want to take my dslr or give to my 6 year old to work on her photography skills . it 's cute too ! i love the vintage look and the video quality is great .
__label__positive__ really great for the price..
__label__positive__ i like it , but is is a little bit small for my staffs . but it 's fair enough for the price
__label__positive__ getting the tiffen name at a great price makes for a fantastic combo ! i have this on my tamron macro lens where tiny details are important . i love the details that are coming out of the lens for sure , but , i do n't think that i 'd get those details if my protective lens filter was a bad quality brand . i have only just started with macro , but i 'm really liking the results !
__label__negative__ battery died after first polaroid print ! !
__label__positive__ got the charger quickly , without a problem . charged up our extra batteries and it works fine !
__label__positive__ all fit very well ... good quality products .
__label__positive__ really surprising
__label__positive__ does not come with clip accessory to put gopro on , need to buy that separate .
__label__positive__ this is my first real camera and so far it has been very easy to use . i am able to find videos to help me get started on my new fledgling hobby and it arrived even faster than expected ! yay for me .
__label__positive__ i really like the build quality of this unit , and once it 's up the use and light quality are just perfect - exactly what you 'd expect from any box of this size. < br / > < br / > the 4-star rating is because assembly is a bit of a pain . the instructions note some features of the rod placement that would make things much easier , but those features are missing from the actual box itself . on the paper , there are supposed to be open pockets with velcro so you can more easily insert and apply tension to the standing supports . they simply do n't exist on the product i received so you have to apply brute-force methods to get the poles in place and erect the assembly. < br / > < br / > i would still buy this , and may buy a spare , but with a few extra dollars i would prefer an umbrella type assembly , or at least the actual design features promised on the instructions. < br / > < br / > the speed ring fits very nicely on my einstein 640s from paul c buff , and adjustment is a breeze . you do have to be a little careful about weight distribution , so if this is your first modifier of this size be aware that you may need to upgrade your light stands . i happen to have this mounted to a rather large dj speaker stand that is meant to hold 150lbs , but basic 8 ' stands will need counter balance .
__label__negative__ never worked with iphone . now in junk drawer .
__label__positive__ good products !
__label__positive__ delivered on time and performance was exactly what was promised
__label__positive__ henry was my representative in helping me setup my foscam camera , he was very professional , patience and knowlegable about my eeds. < br / > < br / > i 've use the foscam camera on several occasion , i 've found it very , very useful and would recommend it to my friends , next month i 'm purchasing another. < br / > < br / > thank you im advance. < br / > < br / > ms . o. sherrod
__label__positive__ great start up kit .
__label__positive__ got these to hang a photo backdrop . they are lightweight but clamp well .
__label__negative__ not compatible with nikon d40
__label__negative__ this does not work . its super cheap , and it doesnt work . at all .
__label__positive__ worked good for money
__label__positive__ great product . .. well built . i have not tested the water resistant factor yet but seems like it would do the job .
__label__negative__ you ca n't even use them ! as soon as you put any tension like opening the loop with your fingers the whole thing comes apart . every single one in the package !
__label__positive__ included battery lasted about 3 hours , functions ok with new $ 7 battery
__label__positive__ great product , love it .
__label__positive__ very good product .
__label__positive__ most places charge much more for these batteries , work good on my camera .
__label__positive__ exactly what i expected ! arrived on time .
__label__positive__ internal charger in kodak playsport bit the dust so found this as the replacement . brought my playsport back to life in short order .
__label__negative__ very long lag time between photos
__label__positive__ we love this product ! it 's our second one . the first one lasted a few years . we put it on when we go to bed at night and on vacation nearby the front door . i highly recommend it !
__label__positive__ this is a great point and shoot camera . response is fairly quick . zoom/ image stabilization work really well for a camera in this price range . battery life is much better than the other cameras i own ( with the original battery- avoid the cheap knock offs ) . < br / > we own quite a few similar or more expensive cameras and this has become our go to for pics of grandkids , pets , flora , and quick scenic shots .
__label__positive__ works great , suitable for close recording in low light areas .
__label__positive__ i 'm able to fit my dx format camera and 3 lenses , cokin filter system with filters , clothes , lunch for the day , snacks and water , first aid kit , rain gear and maps with room to spare.on days when i want to have my tripod i attach it to the straps located at the bottom of the bag , it 's not a light weight tripod and even after miles of hiking i barely know the bag is even there.it 's definitely a comfortable backpack and i bought it for the sole purpose of having my camera with me on hikes.i would definitely recommend this backpack to anyone that enjoys taking photographs while hiking .
__label__neutral__ i 'm reasonably happy with these batteries . i knew they would not match the oem battery in usage time .
__label__positive__ love it ! and film is super cheap , you just have to play around with the focus a little !
__label__positive__ takes beautiful pics !
__label__positive__ the best thing i have ever bought in a longtime ! ! i love this selfie stick . i take it where ever i go and i am going to new orleans this weekend . facebook pics time ! ! ! a must buy
__label__positive__ great product that offers camera protection and the ability to pack some other gear . camera bag is removable and can become its own pack if desired . camera pack sits in the bottom where you want the heaviest items . buy with confidence !
__label__positive__ as advertised .
__label__neutral__ these batteries are ok , but they do require recharging often .
__label__positive__ the detail is incredible ! it 's definitely a challenge to use but the results are worth it .
__label__positive__ the item was as described . quality seems good and it fit my d5100 lens without any problem .
__label__positive__ overall , i love this camera . frustrating that they 've moved some of the buttons in different places from the previous versions . just takes some getting used to . but , i was very unhappy with the condition it came in . maybe it had been a demo or something . if so , it should have said so . the lens had something smeared all over it and was very hard to remove . was very worried about damaging the lens . it was very dusty . the only reason i decided to keep it was because i was in the middle of taking photos of a rare duck and i needed a camera because my other one was in the process of dying on me . i cleaned it up and love the camera . getting beautiful shots and very sharp shots .
__label__positive__ perfectly fits the canon powershot sx700 hs , but with no room for the canon battery charger .
__label__positive__ great value , awesome quality
__label__positive__ our daughter loves it .
__label__positive__ bought this mostly for the air ball .
__label__neutral__ fits fine . not sure how well it will hold up after long usage .
__label__positive__ i consider myself fairly tech savvy , but had put off getting something like this because there is just so much out there . determining what i need versus what each item has can be daunting , especially from a small description blurb online . i came across this after finding the nest cam product . this one is half the price , putting it in my price range , and the only difference i can see being the storage size ( no cloud , nest offers this service at additional cost ) . at any rate , i had it up and running in minutes . exactly what i was looking for . thank you to the reviewer who pointed out it only had to be connected to the router during the set up process ; i had a panic moment and did n't read the rest of the instructions and thought it was n't going to work for me . end result , day one , it 's pretty awesome .
__label__positive__ i received a sample at a discount for an evaluation and honest review. < br / > < br / > as my title states , these are quality microfiber cloths and have worked great on my glasses , computer monitor screens , and on my tv screen . the edges have n't frayed at all on me ( but admittedly i 've only been using them for a couple of weeks ) , and the fabric is holding up just great. < br / > < br / > qkoo sells multiple versions of these clothes in different colors , sizes , and number of cloths per pack . so , you might want to search on amazon to see which package fits your needs better . i prefer the smaller cloths for my glasses , but their biggest cloth for my tv screen. < br / > < br / > at first , i thought it was a bit wasteful for these to come individually packaged ( each cloth is in its own nice wrapper with instructions ) , but after thinking about it , i quite like it . after all , i do n't use a bunch of these all at once , and their packaging lets me easily put the rest in a drawer and keep them clean for when i do want them. < br / > < br / > these are n't abnormal or special in the world of microfiber cloths , but i was n't looking for that . i wanted quality cloths that work , and these fit the bill . i will say that i slightly prefer the feel of the only branded microfiber cloths that i 've used , but the potential downside to those is that the colors are random ( at least in the pack that i got ) and pretty flashy ( like bright yellow and pink ) . these are as pictured and pretty subdued in color if that 's what you like. < br / > < br / > if the price is right when you 're shopping , i definitely recommend these . nicely made , work great , and ( at least at the moment ) fairly priced .
__label__positive__ because of photoshop and how digital cameras are produced , the purple 'fluorescent ' filter is completely useless if you 're using it for digital photography . unless you 're shooting scenes that are relatively far away , the uv filter is n't needed either . however , it makes a perfect lens protector ! assuming it 's clean , it should n't ruin the quality of your photos by any noticeable amount . cpl filters are a photographer 's must ! they are always great to have handy in case you need to eliminate reflections off of glass or reduce ground glare .
__label__positive__ these help in getting off those super thin circular polarizers . they may also help with getting off stuck filters but with limitations . they are n't indestructible and quite thin themselves . if your filter is stuck b/c of dropping or seated incorrectly these may not help or even break if you put too much pressure on them . keeping your hand placement as close to the filter when gripping these wrenches will help prevent them from breaking. < br / > < br / > they work for what they are intended for which is removing circular polarizers and/or filters that are stuck b/c of being over tightened . they are good to have when needed and in a jam .
__label__positive__ thank you so much it arrived a day early and i 'm very very happy great camera and really nice color too love it ! ! ! thanks again was packed very nice as well
__label__positive__ i really wish they sold the extension arms separately as that is all i needed . all other extension arms turn the bolt by 90* which is fine in some cases , for me i wanted everything to straight and no twists involved . this is the only way i could get gopro branded extensions shaped like this. < br / > < br / > gopro , please sell just the extensions !
__label__positive__ no problems , fits perfectly as described . check your lens first to make sure you know what you are ordering .
__label__positive__ i absolutely love this camera ! it replaces a sony dslr that i 've had for 7 years and it does everything and then some !
__label__positive__ it 's great but i bought the prime day bundle so not all accesories fits on it so not perfect for my purchase .
__label__positive__ this is an extremely good case ! wow ! ! great item , great shipping !
__label__positive__ got this for my daughter , she loves it . works as it should , 50 count , and shipping was fast !
__label__positive__ great cameras . i 'm a serious photographer and i 'm using these for a special project and am really amazed at the quality , actually . they are disposable and have no controls , but that 's all the fun . the only thing you need to worry about is framing and content - - great fun to renew your creativity in photography . likely an endangered species , but great fun while they 're still around .
__label__positive__ i have 2 pairs of the cut out style . they are extremely comfortble and fit well . the shape and toe box are perfect . my shoes are two years old and look as good as the day i bought them . i bought another plain style of earthies in leather and they squeak when i walk and fit differently ( feel smaller ) . i still love these shoes and will buy others . just wished they were n't so expensive . i saw a pair of the leather cut out design for $ 230+ ... .. really ? ! ! i 'm not paying that for one pair of black leather flats . do n't price yourself out of reason earthies !
__label__positive__ charges quick and efficiently
__label__positive__ fits cannon sx60 perfect it 's a snug fit that does n't allow any room for bumping around and has room on side pockets for 2 extra batteries and the top has a place inside perfect for cards also has two nylon handle straps on back to carry it that i use a lot more than the strap
__label__negative__ straps break very easily . hardly used in a few months and once i used it two times in a row ( for only a few minutes ) the straps started to come undone .
__label__positive__ ok ... .
__label__positive__ it is ciik
__label__positive__ love this camera . it 's a bit of a dinosaur , but the lens is top notch quality and has a huge zoom capacity . easy to use .
__label__positive__ i travel extensively and have used a number of european power adaptors . i always prefer the skross adaptors because the round base of the adaptor fits into the round opening of european power outlets , creating a much better and more secure connection . the plug will not wobble in the outlet like simple two-prong adaptors do . these are the only adaptors i have found to be constructed this way . if you travel to europe regularly , these are the adaptors you need .
__label__positive__ no performance issues ... ..this link process my photos directly to my computer without any issues .
__label__negative__ very expensive , the material is fragil and one leg was stuck . i really expected more for this price .
__label__negative__ case was way too big . will not be using it as it does not fit in my bag . the & # 34 ; lens cleaning pen system & # 34 ; looks good but i went to test the fabric end on my finger before use and it was filled with a black powder/dust ! the thing was like a marker ! i grabbed some paper and started drawing all over the thing !
__label__positive__ i use this new nifty-fifty on an sl1 and a 20d and it is incredible , i think . every person with a canon dslr that does n't have one of these new stm versions should get one . if you add in the newer 24mm pancake lens , you have the two best cheap lens ' you can get and still get quality pictures out of your older or cheaper canon cameras . you can get closer to objects than the old nifty-fiftys and this is a good thing as well . the bokeh , while criticized as not being as good as the previous one , is far better in my estimation . i am a professional photographer who often sells my pics for thousands of dollars . no , i 'm just kidding . ( i do have a flickr account though and a couple favs on there ... ) anyway , get this lens and you wo n't be disappointed .
__label__positive__ i bought this to replace another nix frame that died . i was a little hesitant as the older frame was n't terribly old but started crashing frequently , even after i swapped out the sd card with a known good one . but we were pleased with the older one while it was working and this one had the motion sensing feature which was attractive. < br / > < br / > the end result is that we really like this one . it has an additional display mode that shows up to four pictures at once which is very attractive . the motion sense works well but that did seem to replace the timed on-and-off that we used before. < br / > < br / > the only serious complaint is that it will only take jpegs , no pngs , or gifs . i had to batch process my selection of pictures to resize them and convert to jpeg . that was n't terribly difficult nor did it take a long time but it really should n't be necessary. < br / > < br / > i would recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced frame .
__label__positive__ works great with the three gallon water bottle we bought for filling it and bringing it home .
__label__neutral__ i bought this camera with the kit because of not so bad reviews and most of the reviews do n't mention issue with waterproof feature of it . so i still hope it is truly waterproof camera . it is yet to be tested for me . i am not planning to snorkel or dive with it . it tells on the box 15 meters which makes for about 50 feet . well , i would divide it at least by 3 if not by 5 for true water depth that camera would hold . i do n't see any heavy rubber around buttons and when you push button in and there is not protective rubber , there is a crack between the body and the button , i would expect . so i would not expect it to work under water . if it does , great ! < br / > i am a fisherman , so i expect just have this camera to work on the river , lake or the ocean surface or above it , and if dropped in the water , not to leak in and spoil the pictures . that would be enough waterproof for me. < br / > < br / > as many mentioned here flash is weak and making pictures indoors is pretty poor , especially if the picture should have depth or you snapping an object in the somewhat not too bright light from 5-7 yards . anything closer than 3 yards is more or less ok. and again , that is exactly the purpose i bought it for . make pictures in close range and outside of the house. < br / > < br / > my issue mostly with the kit . it is not high quality stuff . but 32 gb memory card and extra battery set is helping . the belt with floatant that should keep camera floating if it fail to the water was failure . that small thin thread that should be rapped around the camera handle and hold it to floatant got out of the plastic housing right after i pull it out of the plastic rap . i do n't think it is seller fault , as all items were in the sealed plastic . most probably poor manufacturing . the hole in the plastic housing very small . luckily i have experience working with small parts and have required tools to pool that thread through the small hole in the plastic and tie a little knot on the end of the thread . so all fixed anddone. < br / > < br / > there is that , my review for now .
__label__negative__ i 'm incredibly disappointed . it came without the suction cup which is what i was most looking forward to . i also have a lot of other random pieces that i do n't know what to do with . i understand it 's not go pro brand products . but i was at least hoping to get all of the items i was told i would get .
__label__positive__ perfect !
__label__positive__ i should have gotten one sooner !
__label__positive__ these are great for around the house . we had purchased a pack from walmart originally and liked the features and easy installation . we wanted more and saw amazon had them for cheaper and was capable with the app we already had . we have them facing the outside of the house as well . they are not wired to an alarm company but great for keeping an eye on the pets and backyard and vehicles if your away . it does tell temperature of the room , its plays music and has a two way communication feature . would recommend to anyone wanting alternate security system .
__label__positive__ just what i was looking for . thanks !
__label__negative__ it 's not very stable but thankfully it worked for what i needed to do .
__label__positive__ just a little tight , buts works great !
__label__positive__ awesome product !
__label__positive__ good kit for my college courses .
__label__positive__ perfectly as described , fast shipping thanks .
__label__positive__ i 've used it twice on location and am very happy . the interior is infinitely compatible to whatever amount of gear i want to carry. < br / > thanks lowepro ! stewart hopkins photography
__label__positive__ i have it for my camera . it a bit small.i try to give a description . it the same size as the 1 gallon drinkable bottle .
__label__positive__ i love the fz70 , at least what i 've figured out how to use . it 's quite a complex camera ( at least for a digitally confused man ) , the instructions are relatively adequate , but going on to u-tube i was able to see some of the workings in action . probably just how i learn better , see one do one kinda thing . but the photos are beautiful and when using a tripod i got some terrific shots of the moon that showed more than i 'd been able to get with previous cameras . it has a multitude of scene variations as well as numerous programs that do most anything you would want a camera to do , from total automatic to total manual operation and anything in between. < br / > i was able to purchase a factory refurb unit for a great savings , and i believe from the reviews and what i 've experienced from the limited use so far i believe i found a real diamond in the rough !
__label__positive__ i got this for my daughter 's birthday and she loves it . i bought the accessories but she wants to get more . i 'll leave it up to her to get the extras .
__label__positive__ love it !
__label__positive__ very nice kit , but it could be better with a cleaning solution instead of only the empty bottle .
__label__positive__ perfect for small camera .
__label__positive__ worked out fine ... took it on trip to greece , and did n't fail me.. fast response so appreciate the seller .
__label__positive__ gives my nex-f3 a 28mm prime lens view with all the automatic features for way less than the sony equivalent . ca n't tell the difference in pix from this lens and the oem stuff . well worth it . having f:2.8 available in what has become an f:4 world ( unless you have $ $ $ ) is a big plus also .
__label__positive__ just as described -- and just what i needed -- with perfect shipping ! thanks so much !
__label__positive__ fits great works exactly as it should
__label__positive__ good clear picture < br / > excellent zoom < br / > heavy duty camera mount
__label__positive__ nice lens !
__label__positive__ works great . different concept for camera storage but is great for what i do . simple and stylish .
__label__negative__ simply put : it would not work . the user manual says to charge it overnight before using . just as the batteries of the gopro . when i took it out of the package , it displayed information on the lcd screen , but i left it charging until the morning before trying to do anything with it . in the morning , the gopro batteries were charged and my camera was working beautifully . the remote was dead . would not turn on . charged it on a different computer usb port . still dead . called gopro and waited 26 minutes listening to music . good thing i got this on amazon and can return for a full refund . i guess i will have to work with my iphone to control the camera instead .
__label__negative__ low quality camera : (
__label__positive__ goog size . and seems robust .
__label__positive__ what an amazing deal ! i use this tripod all the time for taping videos and it 's simple , lightweight and does the job . i highly recommend !
__label__positive__ i have taken photos in complete dark with my nikon d5500 . photos are very good and i have observed that intensity of flash is not varying with depending upon the darkness
__label__positive__ great little lens for portrait photography . ca n't beat the price . one of my favorites ! must have for photography !
__label__positive__ nice
__label__positive__ i use this with a swarovski atx95 spotting scope . the vertical damping works great for this scope . wish the horizontal panning and plate lock levers were a bit larger . and the plate can be difficult to slide into the head at times. < br / > < br / > first copy ( at the time only $ 200us ) developed a bit of a wobble . a tiny screw fell out of the threaded tripod socket when i took the head off the tripod legs . returned it to the us distributor ( aragraph ; i had to pay return shipping ) the 2nd one works fine . i now remove the scope from the head when transporting the tripod/scope in a vehicle . this may prevent future occurrence of the problem. < br / > < br / > at the current price of $ 250 i would likely go with the manfrotto mvh500ah at $ 160.00
__label__positive__ works perfectly . delivered exactly as promised . vendor was very responsive and easy to contact and work with !
__label__negative__ can i give this a zero rating ? i got the camera out of the box and tried to open the battery compartment by pushing on the designated arrow . and i pushed and pushed and it did n't move . took me repeated tries over 3 or 4 minutes and it finally popped open . then i got 8 new amazon rechargeable batteries and started to place them in the battery slots . i could barely get the batteries in the slots that had the spring at the far end , but then the batteries were under so much tension that they popped out . i absolutely could not get the batteries in the 2 slots with the spring closest to me . i tried other brands , and my husband tried , but after 15 fruitless minutes we gave up . the slots were just a tiny bit too short . i am really disappointed because i did a lot of research before i ordered this model , and now i have to send it back .
__label__positive__ great drone ! ! love every minute of it ! looking forward to buy the latest version of the dji phamton ! !
__label__positive__ the led has good quality and good lighting , the price is sensational .
__label__positive__ these work great in my door frames . the rare earth magnets seem to have more tolerance for how you mount them . i used a forstner bit to recess the magnets in the door frame , and with a 1/4 & # 34 ; gap , the sensitivity and specificity are on target .
__label__positive__ amazing gopro piece !
__label__positive__ i love tgis light . i 've had for at least two years and it still works great ! not a lot of misfires and the output is good if you are working in a small space .
__label__positive__ this product is perfect ! the liquid dries well without streaking ( just add two to three drops to cover the whole length of the swab ) . the size is perfect for full frame sensors . will definitely buy some more of this product . also if you run out of the aps-c cleaning swab , you can substitute this to clean cropped sensors using an up-to-down sweeping motion instead of left-to-right , and the size is perfect !
__label__positive__ fits well
__label__negative__ i got the batteries and i used and i died quickly
__label__positive__ excellent product
__label__positive__ very nice color !
__label__positive__ up graded my gear and camera and this bag holds it all and then some . awesome bag .
__label__positive__ keeps my nikon coolpix floating and handy . it 's great for the pool and getting those family shots .
__label__positive__ this is a great starter kit for getting off the ground with the gopro system. < br / > < br / > the head strap and the chest harness are nicely made and the quality for all items is great . i also love the suction cup , it is very strong on the car windshield when i used it for a road trip and i also love the selfie stick which i have used to record as a higher vantage point and it makes the video look like you have a small crane you are using to record. < br / > < br / > i was very pleased with the cost of this kit since there were so many pieces included that fit the gopro camera perfectly .
__label__positive__ keeps items inside safe and dry . case is durable and feels solid . usuale pelican quality .
__label__positive__ little softer than i thought but it is a very nice bag for its price . i bought it to carry a coolpix p900 but actually a d7100 with a 18-250 sigma zoom fits fine ( see picture ) .
__label__positive__ very versatile works as expected .
__label__positive__ seems to work fine . great price
__label__positive__ the charger does what it is supposed to do . we are happy with that and that the price was right .
__label__positive__ works fine .
__label__positive__ exactly as advertised . light weight , compact . easy to transport in carrying bag . adjustable from 24 & # 34 ; to 50 & # 34 ; . works well with my samsung mega smart phone .
__label__positive__ this is a great tripod for the money . it is sturdy and easily adjustable and quick and easy to put away . definitely a worthy buy !
__label__positive__ its working great . keeps it charge . cant beat the price . am very happy with my purchase .
__label__neutral__ the foam in the lid was cut on an angle which looks bad even for a cheap case much less one that costs this much !
__label__positive__ great value !
__label__positive__ night vision sucks everything else a+
__label__negative__ do n't do it . i purchased one and had it in a box until my wifi was installed . it was defective and past the amazon return date when i used it the first time . manufacturer is over seas and just sends auto responses . to emails - it 's been months , and nothing .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ excellent flash !
__label__negative__ after about 7 months , one of the camera died on me . it did n't work . i talked to foscam and they decided to send me a refurbished one . that one worked about 6 months and the camera was working but would n't move . i called foscam again and they did their protocol trouble shooting , trying to & # 34 ; reset & # 34 ; the camera by unplugging it and update the firmware . it worked for a couple weeks then it would n't move again . i realized this time that it was n't the firmware issue , it was the motor . it was a mechanical issue , the motor was making grinding noise in trying to rotate or move when i command it too . i called foscam again and they said , sorry warranty has expired and now you have to buy one or repair it at your cost . i told them that they sent me a refurbished one to begin with that only lasted 6 months . they did n't care . now i 'm out about $ 100 for 2 crappy cameras , my original one i bought and the refurbished one that they replace for me . customer service did n't care to response until i sent them 3 emails then their response was , out of warranty ! beware of the product quality and customer service , they do n't care and just want the money .
__label__positive__ love this camera . you wo n't believe the price for size/ weight ratio . the kit lens is ok .
__label__positive__ all i can say is wow ! this order came in super fast and only took 3 days ! the printer itself is great and i have already printed out some pictures . its really easy to use and you can never go wrong with angles and such because you can edit pictures before they print . i personally am a bit of a klutz , and knowing that i figured i would save a lot of money on film if i bought the printer instead of the the camera . although the printer is a bit more expensive its definitely worth the cost in the long run . some technical stuff that i did n't know : make sure to wait a while after the plastic piece comes out during start up ! do not turn it off while it is humming ! i thought i did something wrong , but the printer makes a noise after each print come out . other than that your good to go ! ! i definitely recommend this product and the service was great as well : d
__label__positive__ very easy to install . for those with trouble using the torque screw driver , i only tightened until i met a bit of resistance . i would say about 1n/m of force . i did this because i only need it to be water resistant , not proof ( i use it for biking and rafting , not for scuba diving ) .
__label__negative__ never made it pass setup , green light for power and internet , tried using pc , phone , tablet and still never could get it to get beyond the setup . checked netgear website for support , spent and hour searching around on their site and never found a solution . tried resetting my internet and the arlo base station more times than i can count . i spent about 4 hours messing with it and could n't get it to setup . called netgear , after an hour being on hold i just decided to return it and buy a dropcam .
__label__negative__ piece of junk . broke quickly .
__label__positive__ a serious must have tool for any camera rig . i have four of them .
__label__positive__ those is working pretty good for flash , it 's perfect , i like it
__label__positive__ i really like this diffuser and it fits perfectly over the light . i will be using this for weddings to soften the light and it is great quality for the price .
__label__neutral__ i guess it 's not it 's fault , but it rings every time even a leaf falls past it . so it has gotten to the point where i stopped looking to see if someone was there . also , i got it so i would know if someone was sneaking up to the house ( i have recently encountered a problem with someone ) so i do n't like the bright blue light when someone walks past . it is plenty loud , which is good .
__label__positive__ the camera is compact and will fit easily in a backpack or purse . the lcd view is a full 3 & # 34 ; . although small , the camera has a 16 megapixel lens and 12x optical zoom . i was very pleased with my first photographs . if you had a large camera before it may take an adjustment period to get use to a lightweight one . probably not a good choice for someone with large hands .
__label__positive__ seens , so far , like a good deal . if the batteries last a long tine , even better .
__label__positive__ does the job i needed it for . clamping system is secure and adjustable .
__label__positive__ fast and perfect.. thanks
__label__positive__ what can i say , i have bought the d40 as a beginning camera , then the d90 - and now i have graduated to this and i love it ! i have only had it two days but so far i am impressed . yesterday i climbed on a ladder to take this picture of a dragonfly , hand held . the focusing is much better than the d90 and i love that camera !
__label__negative__ charged once i received them went to used them a month later they did not hold a charge
__label__positive__ easy to install . holds my iphone 6 plus . it 's a tight fit .
__label__positive__ paired easily with smartthings and works great . my only problem is you ca n't control the timeout reset . it 's default is 4 minutes to reset as other reviewers have stated . you can change the jumpers to test mode and this allows it to reset as soon as motion stops .
__label__negative__ the slate detached from the clapper after a few days of use . i adhered it back in myself– just annoying , and somewhat embarrassing .
__label__positive__ it works well with practically any camera or tripod , and picks up sound quite nicely .
__label__positive__ a little difficult to program but youtube will help you do it . once you get it working its a great product and it looks nice too .
__label__positive__ great ! ! !
__label__positive__ this is a well made product , i was able to take it out last weekend. < br / > it did what i wanted , it made my day , great < br / > < br / > thnx < br / > d carter
__label__positive__ solidly built with high quality components . i 've been using it as a kicker on several long interviews and the batteries have lasted through with no problems . i noticed a slight green shift in the color , but not bad . the magnetic filters are a little hard to take off and the screw mount is a little annoying , but overall a great light for the cost .
__label__positive__ works great ! ! and really cuts down on the post production time . when using different cameras the color can be slightly off to a great deal off , even with the same camera bodies . by making color corrected presets for each one , your photos closely resemble each other . i do recommend watching the videos on using the product for the first time ( its just easier ) . this is the first step to color correction for your photos , second is to edit them on a color calibrated monitor ( a high quality monitor where the color output is 100 % of srgb , and as close to 100 % of adobe rgb really helps ) finally either send your photos off to a lab for printing or buy spyder print and calibrate your printer .
__label__positive__ seems to work real good as a dash can in car , you can also plug a power cord in it and run it all day long , also records over old video 's .
__label__positive__ received in excellent condition . easy to use out of the box . picture quality was excellent .
__label__positive__ it works for my needs .
__label__positive__ very useful tool . i have a them on all my canons that will support the battery grip .
__label__positive__ totally awesome ! light weight and fit to any face ! the clarity is perfect !
__label__positive__ my grandson loved this and the microscope that went with it . thanks
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ i have used the flash several times and find it very satisfactory . the only problem is that the instructions are almost impossible to understand . i have had to learn by trial and error and have much yet to learn . thank you for your concern and help .
__label__positive__ good price and product .
__label__positive__ this have worked out great . i 've had them for about six months now and they 're in great condition . definitely a great price for such and excellent product
__label__positive__ good to go
__label__positive__ i really love the wireless remote to make use of the as100v that i have for my motorcycle riding . no fumbling with the camera - just click the record button on the remote . i like being able to view the screen to see my aim without having to take out my expensive smartphone .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ easy setup , works great !
__label__positive__ great little tripod ! lightweight and quick to set up ! < br / > i wish it was a little sturdier as it is really easy to knock over , but i try not to put myself in rowdy situations when i break this baby out. < br / > the fabric of the bag is thin but sturdy and in over 2 years has yet to rip or tear. < br / > the size is perfect for going 1ft . high to around 4 ft. high .
__label__positive__ pelican products are always top drawer . their products just simply work . i have 5 of them now for carrying my family history camera and accessories to interviews with relatives . good product . highly recommend .
__label__positive__ fantastic camera . can not tell you anything about the vide as i am a photographer and did not get this camera for video .
__label__negative__ loved it at first but after three months it stopped working with my nikon . i took it to two photography equipment specialists and they both said it was common with sigma to stop syncing it 's autofocus function and that it was more expensive to repair than it was worth . of course , it is too late for me to return so i 'm out the cost of the lens plus the cost of a new lens . beware !
__label__positive__ setting up the monitor using the software is super easy and the difference between a calibrated monitor and an uncalibrated monitor is amazing . the software has a reminder service to alert you when you need to recalibrate your monitor ( time set by you ) and the software also allows you to calibrate several monitors . i used this on both my laptop monitor and separate computer monitor with excellent results
__label__positive__ awesome and useful mount , now i can use my gopro accesories with my small dslr
__label__positive__ decent quality
__label__positive__ as advertised !
__label__positive__ performs well and holds charge . ca n't expect less for a nikon product .

__label__positive__ it 's awesome and you should be jealous that i have one and you do n't : )
__label__positive__ excellent product !
__label__negative__ works but a bit cheap
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ works fine
__label__neutral__ been plugged in for 8 hours , batt still not charged
__label__positive__ works great easy set up will be buying more
__label__negative__ i 'm very disappointed because instead of getting sony a5100 i got an sony a5000 .
__label__positive__ just what i was looking more . exceeded my expectations .
__label__negative__ this battery is not a real canon ; it is probably a cheap chinese manufacturer that copy the canon logo on it .
__label__positive__ i like the dual switches
__label__positive__ this mirrorless camera is my first . even though it suffers somewhat from some slow autofocus problems . i find it very useful with video shooting . buy a closeup viewing hood for the video part . sharp 22mm f2 lens and too many features to mention .
__label__positive__ ok so far
__label__positive__ great little camera . has the features and then some . easy to allow your creative side to come forward .
__label__positive__ worked as expected , pretty good batteries .
__label__positive__ i was looking for a more comfortable strap for my camera when i came across this cross-body sling style camera strap . it had the top ratings and it had the most reasonable price . i am so glad i got it . it was shipped within the appropriate amount of time and when i received my order there was a personalized thank you not on my receipt , something i thought was a nice touch. < br / > < br / > the strap is easy to put onto the camera especially if you use the instructions that were inserted into the little red bag that held the & # 34 ; camera link & # 34 ; and the & # 34 ; slip lok & # 34 ; , two devices that are needed to attach the strap correctly . this strap is different than many of the others on the market , it attaches to the camera on the strap lug on the right side of the camera instead on the bottom of the camera . the strap is adjustable and it hangs very comfortably and at the right height for me . my camera does n't hang upside down and is easy to use while on the strap , and it does n't get in the way when i shoot. < br / > < br / > i really love this strap and when i ever get another camera , i will purchase again , and i will definitely suggest this strap to other photographers . i truly liked to personal touch of the thank you note on my receipt , something you do n't see much today . thanks fastfire for making a great camera strap that i hope to use for a very long time .
__label__positive__ this fits perfectly in my backpack to turn the front pouch into a camera bag ! this way i can bring other things like clothes , water bottles , snacks , maps , etc . dedicated bags are n't quite as versatile , so this gives you the best of both worlds : )
__label__negative__ very poor quality
__label__positive__ works great !
__label__positive__ this camera is awesome ! ! i was so excited to have been able to test it for my son 's birthday party today ! can not wait to use it again to document more memories ! !
__label__positive__ i bought this for my slik u-8000 and it fits perfectly . well made and a good value for the money . a nice professionally looking case .
__label__positive__ a great little security camera loaded with exceptional features
__label__positive__ fit and finish of the product is very good and it worked well in my application ( on a triumph bonneville as well as on a microphone stand ) . i did have a problem that was completely my fault and i contacted nordic flash about a replacement piece . they took care of the problem very quickly . i will not hesitate to buy another product from nordic flash due to their excellent customer service .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ i purchased this and a swivel ball head to make overhead shots of artwork and more . instead of sand in the bag , i just use plastic bottles with water to achieve the desired weight . not only is this cleaner but i can then pour out the water when i 'm done which means i have less weight to carry and nothing to store but empty plastic bottles ( or i can just recycle them ) .
__label__positive__ bought 3 of these .
__label__positive__ selfie stick < br / > the luxsure selfie stick is great ! it allows me to get pictures of my family together without having to bother strangers to take the picture for us . i have had so much fun with my kids taking pictures of ourselves with this . its extendable and has good range , over 30 inches . it is bluetooth so you just have to sync with your phone then are good to go . it is adjustable , so it fit all our phones just fine , from an iphone 4s to my iphone 6 plus . it feels sturdy and i do n't have to worry about my phone falling and breaking .
__label__positive__ this bag is unstoppable . i use mine daily as i am a seasoned film director/cinematographer/photographer . i 've had one for a few years now and it has been through everything . traveled across the country with this bag and dragged it through every possible situation/terrain possible . i 'd buy a new one to replace the wear & tear , but there is no wear & tear ! best.bag.ever . buying another one for my younger brother for his birthday. < br / > < br / > ps i had former nba star penny hardaway sign my bag haha that 's all i had with me
__label__positive__ ar004214 did an awesome job of setting up my system and cameras . i am very happy with the tech support and service from dlink .
__label__positive__ wow , great price for a product that worked perfectly the first time !
__label__positive__ bought this for my daughter and she loves it !
__label__negative__ the only problem i have had with both the l27 and the l28 is the catch on the battery compartment has broken . it is poor quality and breaks easily . so beware , unless nikon has improved the design .
__label__positive__ not bad at all for the price . thanks .
__label__positive__ performs as expected !
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ downside is the screen is very small picture qulity prfect i like it .
__label__positive__ i purchased this camera due to the high ratings and good price . shipping was quick . the camera has a nice zoom feature which enables us to get clear and tight pictures while water skiing and wakeboarding . the camera also has a nice video feature that captures video in hd format . a lanyard , battery , data transfer cable and battery charger were included . the camera can be charged via the usb port when plugged into a computer or it can be charged by way of a regular electrical outlet . the camera is very compact and light weight .
__label__positive__ super camera should have upgraded years ago
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ very good cam . easy to set up . i own a dropcam , samsung smart cam and now this r-tech plug and play cam. < br / > sound recording in hd is a little choppy as well as the video playback .
__label__positive__ i love my vivitar battery and charger kit for my sony nex 5r camera . it works great and i received the items promptly .
__label__positive__ this camera delivered great pics on our vacation . the zoom capability is excellent for a moderately priced point-and-shoot model . very happy with the purchase .
__label__positive__ i was looking for something to mount somewhat small powered speakers high on a wall , and frustrated by limited options . some options were far too expensive , other could n't adjust angles like i wanted or hold enough weight . i did have to make my own mounting hardware to attach the speakers , but once i did these served the purpose well . solid metal construction gives me confidence they 'll hold up .
__label__positive__ great drone , fun to play with . i had some trouble with one of the motors . contacted the seller and they went out of their way to get the motor replaced . i 'm back in the air and having fun with it . it is fun for the kids as well . would recommend this quadcopter for beginners as a way to try it for a great price .
__label__positive__ works great , surpassed my expectations
__label__positive__ the sound quality blows my mind
__label__neutral__ pretty disappointing . i want a 15-in + frame to display professional quality photos and so far have found nothing that seems to please other discriminating viewers . surely someone must make a quality frame . cost is not a major factor but quality is top priority . anyone have suggestions ?
__label__neutral__ ok for the money , but really only that . the tripod will work fine in most circumstances , little wind and reasonable load . the ball head leaves a bit to be desired . by no means is it a precision machine . i returned it and purchased a suiri tripod and head . cost more , but way better , though it is heavier and larger .
__label__positive__ the camera not only has the good quality , but also offer the best services , besides the price of the product is reasonable .
__label__positive__ these are the perfect lights for my needs . i am a blogger and take photos daily , of products that i review . the adjustable stands make it easy for me to get them the exact height that i need . great price .
__label__positive__ great and fast way to capture moments . it 's so fun to take pictures with this camera ! the product is exactly as described and adorable !
__label__positive__ this is an amazing camera ... it takes amazing pictures ... this is coming from a professional photographer
__label__negative__ nice build , light weight , but really to much trouble to use and adjust when i telescoping stick is so much more convenient
__label__positive__ this is a great skeleton frame mount -- it 's my default gopro housing . the only time i switch it out is when i 'm going to be filming in/near a body of water . i also like the lens covers it comes with . keep in mind , and this is true of any lens cap/cover that you use with your gopro : do not twist them when removing them from the lens ! ! that will lead to the lens trim coming loose and breaking off .
__label__positive__ my dji phantom vision plus 3.0 had an issue with rotor # 1 not rotating properly when idling . the rotor would twitch on and off . during flight the motor would rotate properly at full rotation speed and the uav would function fine . i replaced the esc with this one from amazon and it fixed the problem. < br / > < br / > installation was easy and took about 40 minutes . you have to remove the entire top cover and then do some soldering work ( five wires total ) . i have experience with electronics repair but a novice might find this job to be intimidating . take your time and be careful with the soldering iron and you will be fine .
__label__positive__ ca n't get a better dashcam for the money . sure , it does n't have wifi , or pre-recording , or multi-channels , but all that is n't really necessary . this camera serves the fundamental needs of recording daily driving , being fairly inconspicuous , and being worry free . you turn the car on , it starts recording , turn the car off , it stops recording . with a 32gb sd card , you can easily get a few weeks of footage before needing to format the sd card ( wipe the memory ) .
__label__neutral__ it has slipped off a couple times . but in fairness , i may not have put it entirely on . it does n't fit over the lens filters i purchased .
__label__positive__ this worked great for our purposes . it comes as two separate pieces , the top and the bottom , each about 4 feet high and 30 feet long . for help hanging on difficult surfaces ( we hung ours on a concrete block wall to which tape just would n't stick ) use the 3m command hooks on the wall . we then hung tiny binder clips from the hooks , and clipped up the background with those- stayed up all week and easy to adjust .
__label__positive__ a
__label__positive__ works well -- as advertised
__label__positive__ great lasts forever
__label__negative__ i spent hours on the phone trying to get the cloud recording to work with no success . their phone support is very lacking . the iluv website specifically states that the basic free plan included with the camera at no extra cost includes 10 second recordings of motion capture events that are supposed to be stored to the cloud for 24 hours . this feature did not work and the customer phone support could not even tell me if it was actually a feature . instead of capturing video , all it did was a still shot . after being promised replies within 24 hours , i never did get an email or call back . in addition , capture of motion events ( still shots ) was very irregular . at times you could basically dance in front of the camera and it would not record a motion event . if you want a camera for just live viewing , this will work , but there are comparable alternatives for much cheaper . if you want a security camera that can capture video of an intruder in your residence and safely store it remotely ... this is a fail , try something else. < br / > < br / > in summary : < br / > no recording as advertised. < br / > inconsistent motion capture. < br / > poor tech support .
__label__negative__ put it on my brand new nikon d5300 , took some pictures , and i realized two things after i went to remove it. < br / > < br / > 1 ) it does not add much to the picture . you can barely tell the difference between a picture taken with this lens and a picture taken without this lens. < br / > 2 ) and i can not stress enough how key this is : it got stuck on my camera . unscrewed the lens from the adapter ring , and when i went to unscrew the adapter ring , i could not unscrew it . i know for a fact i only screwed it on until it was just snug . still , i had to use pliers , gripping it on the threads , to unscrew it. < br / > < br / > the amount of hassle i 'd have to go through to use this product is not worth the very minor benefits of it. < br / > < br / > extremely disappointed . will not be buying another vivitar product again .
__label__negative__ i wanted to like this camera , but sand got under the shutter button the very first time i used it at the beach . back it went . if you need something for the pool and not the beach , this would work great .
__label__positive__ for what i consider a relatively low price i feel that i now have an adequate video based security system for my home . i did need to contact tech support though to get things working properly . apparently , their chat system is n't working and i could n't get through on the phone . but i did get an email response about my configuring the system for internet use . the written instructions said i needed to use ie to set things up for internet use but the tech told me i actually needed to use the opera browser , which i had to first download and install . after that i was able to access my cameras using a remote computer . i was not able to configure the system for smart phone use because the 3g android ( trac ) phone was not compatible with the apps they had available .
__label__negative__ was very optimistic about this product after testing underwater shooting in pool but when i took it on my snorkeling trip and dove no more than 10 feet , camera advertised to go down to 33 feet , the product began to malfunction and i was n't able to take any underwater water photos . not only that the seal that encloses my memory card must have been faulty and leaked so my memory card is wet and all of my pictures that were on the card are now gone . if this camera is for a special one-time underwater event do n't take the chance on it and buy something else otherwise good luck and hope it turns out better for you than it did for me
__label__negative__ does n't work .
__label__positive__ amazing
__label__positive__ i have wasabi batteries for my canon cameras and gopro hero 2 and 3 . better than oem , more power so they last longer . love the batteries , the chargers are ok - they use the same base and just attach the appropriate battery specific connector . this keeps sliding off . annoying .
__label__positive__ one of the best low budget cameras . super cool pictures and the display is really awesome . only thing is the delay while taking the snap which i do n't worry about . excellent 5 start .
__label__negative__ horrible telescope save your money and buy the more expensive one finding anything is extremely difficult unless you are looking for the moon and even that does n't look great , aligning the eye piece with your eye piece is like aligning it to a cellphone camera sensor , and your kidding yourself if you think you can see planets with this thing , and if you think the accessories kit will help , it wo n't , the finder scope does n't work , the eye pieces are of the same quality as the ones that come with the telescope . do n't get me started on the construction because it looks like someone glued a couple mirrors on a pringles can . do not buy this it 's a waist of money .
__label__positive__ vivitar makes good filters that you can trust . this seller has given super quick service and a good price . i highly recommend !
__label__positive__ i thought this deal was too good to be true , especially since authentic gopro accessories are very pricey . the chest and head harnesses are elastic , and the headstrap is rubberized to ensure a firm grip . my friend has the same exact kit and used the suction mount on the outside of her car on the freeway and it stayed put . the monopod ( which i use the most out of the entire kit ) is n't the best quality , but i am still extremely happy with how it has held up for the entire summer . very happy with this purchase ! !
__label__positive__ amazing camera , great price , easy to use . would recommend to anyone , it 's perfect for a beginner like me .
__label__negative__ could n't get a picture to show on the screen . directions very poor . tried some you- tube video instruction to no avail . toshiba laptop should work with it but does n't . emailed protensic but never got an answer . do n't know what else to do .
__label__positive__ i 'd give a 5 but the one section on the suction cup mount is limited on its range of movement . still works good but was a little annoyed with it .
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ this little case does the job . i take it with me when ever i travel . it 's small enough to fit under the front seat of my car for easy access and to keep hidden , and after dropping it has n't damaged anything. < br / > < br / > it holds all 3 of my batteries , gopro in case , a select few mounts , doors , remote , and chargers for the remote and camera. < br / > < br / > it 's perfect for fast daily travel and fits in my back pack easily as well .
__label__positive__ the case smelled like fish idk why but other than the funky smell all my go pro things fit .
__label__negative__ i did n't receive a bonus and the flash did n't fit sigma 15 the sd card were n't any good they work
__label__negative__ these did not fit my go pro hero 3 dive case . do not buy . horrible buy .
__label__negative__ need seller to contact me , sending back today . after i received it i noticed it does not line up correctly on my camera . well built but does not fit correctly . returning for refund .
__label__positive__ perfect : )
__label__negative__ cheap . my strobe have taken a beating because of these things . they do n't cinch down and hold them very well .
__label__positive__ perfect . fit like the originals .
__label__negative__ very hard to operate no way to know if it 's recording or taking a picture until after the fact ... .
__label__positive__ how do you love a charger ? the merchandise is working fine . what i needed .
__label__positive__ good
__label__negative__ do n't waste your money on this . did not fit my gopro 4 silver properly , the floating handle stick was the worst . it took in water after a day in the pool and now its worthless ; cant get the water out . the selfi stick is cheap and made for cellphones . the spider floaty back does not come with its own door ; consider that when buying it . better off buying the gopro floaty which includes the door .
__label__positive__ effortless set-up and pack-up of all of these type screens . saves a lot of time for chromakey , etc . recommended. < br / > they used to come in a really nice zippered heavy-duty blue case with handles , which itself could be put to use as a small blue screen .
__label__positive__ this is good place to store and protect the camera . sadly it is too small for the camera i purchused .
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ this is invaluable for setting up a variable focus camera , while you 're up on a ladder . it 's self-contained and straps to your wrist , and even provides power to the camera so you can view exactly what the camera sees , before you finalize placement .
__label__neutral__ noticed some color fringing in the corner of some images .
__label__negative__ i was very happy at first . i installed the battery and everything seemed great until i tried to charge it . thats when i figured out i got ripped off . very disappointed . i have a new battery that i ca n't charge .
__label__positive__ they fit and do the job , although they seem to have less capacity than the fuji batteries . on the plus side , the included charger is much more compact than the one that came with the camera .
__label__positive__ this is an absolutely fantastic product . installed and configured right out of the box with little hassle . the cameras are very clear , and while i 'd prefer stronger night-vision capbilities , i understand that for the price this is very good , and i have turned on more & # 34 ; always-on & # 34 ; outside floodlights to help the units . the android and iphone app works flawlessly , and i can see my business from anywhere in the world now. < br / > < br / > i also really like that you can set a motion sensor alarm for certain hours/days . so when it 's triggered i get an alarm email on my cell phone along with a still capture of what triggered it . i also love the playback functionality on the mobile app , so i can go back and see any camera 's activity from a certain time/day. < br / > < br / > i know there are more robust systems out there , some from this same maker . but this 4-camera system covered the inside and outside of my business perfectly , and i could n't be happier with it .
__label__negative__ no good bad quality even on hd wasted a lot of money on this pretty disappointed
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid : cc617b84f7332e6a8ce3258a1b2d269b ] ] experienced photographers know that sometimes there is simply no substitute for a tripod . yet we often trade the stability of a tripod for the convenience of one less thing to carry ... < br / > < br / > the goma squid is an excellent compact , portable tripod that can help make sure you have at tripod available even when you want to travel light. < br / > < br / > the squid includes the tripod base ( with a standard 1/4\\ '' mounting screw ) and two adapters : one a universal smart phone adapter and one a gopro adapter. < br / > < br / > the smartphone adapter is spring loaded and worked fine with samsung galaxy s5 . i do n't have a gopro , so could n't test that adapter . the mounting test of a squid with a full size dslr was surprisingly successful . while i do n't think this is an intended use case , with some attention to weight/balance , it comfortably held the dslr ( with a standard lens ; i would n't try it with a telephoto lens ) . more importantly , if it stands up under the mass of a dslr , it will easily stand the challenge of a smaller point-and-shoot camera. < br / > < br / > press the legs together , and you get a handle that you can use as a compact selfie stick ... without being an annoying user of a full-length selfie stick ! < br / > < br / > in addition to still photography , this also provides a stable platform for capturing video or streaming video applications using a smart phone. < br / > < br / > nice tripod . select with confidence. < br / > < br / > note : this item provided for review purposes .
__label__positive__ as long as you can get past the poorly translated english , this is a very solid camera . i like the motion detection messages , and the ability to record at any time . my dog is not a fan of the two way intercom feature , but it is handy nonetheless . the only downside is that the wi-fi range is not very good at all . 10 feet away , with two walls in between , and i could not get it to connect . but i 'm using it in the same room as my router now , so it is a non issue .
__label__positive__ do what they need to do , great little piece of equipment .
__label__positive__ fits my cacoc rebel 3ti . did wish the auto focus worked with it but other than that i 'm very pleased .
__label__positive__ they are best battery i 've ever used very good product do n't mess with the rest
__label__positive__ this was purchased as a tripod for my spotting scope . after reading all of the reviews on both cheaper and more expensive tripods i decided on this and i am extremely happy ! ! ! ! this is well built , sturdy , easy to adjust and will hold my heavier spotting scope steady yet easy to swivel . this is by far the best tripod i have owned , for the money you can not go wrong ! ! ! thanks , joe
__label__positive__ decent quality with good features . i like the feet which can be either spike for outdoor , or you can unscrew the rubber guards to get rubber indoor feet . reasonably stable and adjustable . i do think the tilt/pan mechanism is a little weak though , i feel like i really have to tighten it to lock it in . i like the built in bubble level for the tripod and horizontal level for the tilt/pan mechanism. < br / > < br / > i bought this for a cheap way to support my bosch laser . it works , but i realized later that i really needed an elevator tripod that extends much higher than this one does . also , the tilt/pan mechanism is all but useless for a laser application , as it is not precision adjustable . i did not take any points off for this , as i realize this is a camera tripod , not a laser tripod .
__label__negative__ it sucks . i try instslling them but right after i turned then on they would start going off after like 3 seconds withought separating them
__label__positive__ love it , just love it. < br / > < br / > simple to install , connect & configure .
__label__positive__ great charge and holds it well .
__label__positive__ for what i paid for this mic i thought it would be a lot lower in quality . my audio sounds amazing !
__label__neutral__ i bought two of these and one of the neewer® 160 led cn-160 and my intent here is to compare them both. < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > battery level indicator < br / > easy battery mounting < br / > removable mount < br / > magnetic filters are easy to use < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > not as bright as the neewer® 160 led cn-160 ( -1 star ) < br / > easy to accidentally turn on in bag , must transport without battery ( -1 star ) < br / > can not easily make custom filters
__label__positive__ the gopro pole was great ... i used it for my traveling everywhere , including while snorkeling in the water ! the lanyard part of the pole broke , but the pole was quickly sent in new !
__label__positive__ recently received , it appears a sturdy , well made monopod . just purchased a ball head for it ,
__label__positive__ great unit
__label__positive__ this is a very fun camera , i appreciate fuji for picking up the mantle after polaroid , but it is seems a little oversized . in fact it is huge .
__label__positive__ this is a great camera for the price . it has all the basic accessories for mounting . the waterproof case is pretty tight . that is not a bad thing , because it keeps the water out of the body of the camera . it is a little tricky to open when in a hurry . but i deal with it just fine . not sure if there is a different lens you can buy , but sometimes the fish eye view is strange . i guess all the action cams for this price do this , so i wo n't complain about it . overall , great buy and nice pictures and videos .
__label__positive__ this monitor is my daily moneymaker . my clients wants me to bring this monitor to every filming that they call me to . focus peaking feature is top pick . i bought few of these monitor due to popular demand by clients . if you want to stand out from crowd , purchase this monitor and you will be the attention .
__label__positive__ works great so far . 9 charges and still rolling like duracell .
__label__positive__ works pretty well and is easy to set up.. the software was n't the greatest and i ca n't control horizontal movement well , but the camera has been reliable and works .
__label__neutral__ daytime picture quality is awesome , some of the cameras have blurred picture at night
__label__positive__ i did a lot of research before purchasing this camera . some of my requirements : -easy set up -2 way audio -ability to use with iphone -ability to adjust view and be able to view the entire room from my iphone ; to adjust camera movement up/down and left/right this camera exceeded my expectations . i am not a techy but have enough common knowledge of how things work and that 's all you need . the ability to follow directions that are step by step and detailed and know where to find your network name/password . when i had issues with how to move the camera from my phone i called and when i had issues with the live mode reading 0kb & the end with a red dot next to it . i spoke to the same helpful person and he helped me fix the issue . tip ; if anyone reading has those issues for the 0kb & the end one delete the app , redownload and re sign in with your user name and password . my only recommendation would be to include how to move up/down and left/right from your phone , you just swipe up/down and left/right and with your phone you have control of the camera , the camera actually moves whichever way , it 's very neat ! ! the purpose i am using the camera for is to keep an eye on my sometimes trouble making dog while i 'm at work and while they 're in the dog bedroom . i 've recommended to many other pet lovers .
__label__positive__ perfect fit for a chrome messenger and a lowepro slingshot 202
__label__positive__ worked great with my nikon d60 alt . very easy to carry with belt loop when trekking .
__label__positive__ thanks
__label__positive__ very sturdy , i would recommend it..
__label__neutral__ was playing around with the product found it a neat device to use .here 's hoping with was a bit longer
__label__neutral__ what is n't clear is that the & # 34 ; wireless & # 34 ; requires an app that apparently does not work with most phones . obviously , this was a big reason to purchase this camera . the picture quality seems to be good , as expected . but without the wireless function the camera 's very small monitor makes it extremely difficult to compose decent photos and videos. < br / > also , as a side note , i had ordered the camera in advance of a scheduled cruise . i was looking forward to taking underwater pictures and videos . amazon guaranteed delivery the day before the cruise , only to have the date modified to the same day as the cruise . needless to say , i did n't get the fantastic underwater shots on my cruise though i had a nice camera waiting for me upon my return . ugh !
__label__positive__ this was probably the most noticeable upgrade i did to my entry level starmax90mm mak telescope . worth it , plus the single point locking mechanism is way more convenient than the 2 one .
__label__neutral__ i purchased this everything looks simple and easy to hook up. < br / > just not sure what to think yet ... the product description ~~~ & # 34 ; the camera is perfect for indoor & outdoor to monitor your home and business *ip66 waterproof metal housing for hassle free use in rainy or snowy days & # 34 ; < br / > < br / > the directions that came with the cameras under precautions the 6th bullet down says & # 34 ; do not install outside or allow liquid contamination & # 34 ;
__label__negative__ camera lasted less than a week . said it 's waterproof by reviewer : great underwater camera better then most waterproof cameras . my grandson took this on outward bound rafting/mountaineering trip and water splashed on it . no longer worked . he had the wrist strap on it and it was not put in the water . i find this unacceptable and not only that , it is no longer returnable after 30 days . really ? this is not a camera i would buy and when i went to read more about it just now i could not find out anything about return policy being 30 days. < br / > < br / > i would not recommend this camera to anyone .
__label__negative__ did not work . so inexpensive i did n't bother to send it back . just order another more expensive one the next go around .
__label__positive__ i like that there are no batteries to charge and it works exactly as expected . i ca n't compare it to others but my nine year old loves to use it .
__label__positive__ bought these to hook thumb drives to for my clients ... . what can i say ... they are inexpensive ... and they do exactly what they are made to do ... good job
__label__positive__ received this battery as scheduled . charged well . i have kept this as a back up for my d600 . i have n't used it much . if i had and it performed well i would have given it 5 stars .
__label__negative__ the zoom is not great , and i have had issues with pictures appearing pixculated . i am very aggravated with this camera .
__label__positive__ battery and charger are good
__label__neutral__ i bought this battery grip for a nikon d3300 . it would not connect all the way so i had to take a dremel and shave away some of the plastic lip that was blocking the battery contacts from connecting . after that it finally works . seems sturdy enough .
__label__negative__ the one that i got came in a box with one cable . the cable charged the camera and ( usb ) hooked up to a pc . i did that once and then it stopped working . i downloaded directions and read them . since it did not work this was a waste of time . open box . my mistake .
__label__negative__ piece of crap ! as soon as it was plugged into my ipad , it did n't work . got a red indicator light instead of green . the connector also broke !
__label__negative__ long story short - you get what you pay for . first off this is a discontinued model . bought this in february 2015 and it seemed to work great . then i had problems with viewing over the internet not working and also the unit freezing and having to be unplugged . contacted support and they sent me a firmware upgrade . after that it seemed to work fine ... for a month or so . then two of the cameras failed . they sent me an rma for warranty repair and i am still waiting on those so we will see if they get fixed/replaced . as of today the system freezes quite frequently when trying to payback video . it does this whether trying locally through the dvr itself or remotely over the internet . it freezes and reboots itself almost daily . i will be submitting yet another request for tech support and see where it goes . update 8/11/15 - i have had three cameras fail and replaced under warranty so far ... one of those three has already failed . as for the dvr rebooting itself and freezing up , all tech support ever tells me to do is do a factory reset.. so i loose all my custom settings and past recordings as a hard drive reformat is part of the reset . the reset works for a few weeks then it starts freezing up again . as for the cameras.. they do not cover shipping in for the returns ( only shipping back to you ) , so i have spent a little over $ 30 in returns so far . going to start looking elsewhere to replace cameras as they fail.. and i know they will . i 'd rather spend a little more on replacing a camera with another brand that actually works than have to send it in ( paying shipping ) for replacement every month or so . update 1/18/16 - i have had to send all 8 original cameras back under warranty after they failed . even 2 of the warranty replacement cameras failed within a few months of receiving them . so i have had 10 cameras fail . they are good about replacing them under warranty but even the replacement cameras fail after a short time . they either get stuck in day-mode so no night viewing , or the colors get distorted with the entire image having a pink or purple hue to it . the last camera they sent me as a replacement has a blurry image past about 20 feet and focus is not adjustable , i tolerated it but it only took a few weeks for the colors to go bad . my orange trashcan appears dark green in the color image . horrible life on these . i am giving up on warranty replacements and just going to start shopping for another brand system .
__label__negative__ sucks
__label__positive__ solid cable
__label__neutral__ ca n't use auto focus but these little lens adapters are pretty neat
__label__positive__ very good .
__label__positive__ just what i expected
__label__negative__ specifcations on size not complete
__label__neutral__ i bought this as a replacement for a similar 30x magnifier i 've used for years , which has just worn out . the bulb can be moved into two positions , one for direct illumination and a second for indirect illumination . that 's a nice feature but the swivel mechanism is very tight and difficult to manipulate on the one i received . the incandescent bulb has a molded lens to focus the light . unfortunately the bulb filament is off center so the light does not focus correctly for direct illumination . at least it worked for indirect illumination but after about 10 minutes of use the light went out and wo n't work at all . i 'm not sure if the bulb is burned out or the switch is defective . so , at this point i 'm rather displeased with the overall quality . except for the problems with the light the product is ok .
__label__positive__ works perfectly with d3200
__label__positive__ the kastar battery shows up on my sony dsc-hx9v camera with about 120 minutes of stills shooting time and about 50 minutes of hd video shooting time ( slightly longer than previous sony or non-oem batteries ) , which , over the last couple of months seems to be somewhat accurate . however the battery remaining charge icon next to the remaining shooting time always shows the battery as on its last bar of charge , even when it was freshly recharged through over over a dozen recharge cycles. < br / > < br / > while the battery icon is inaccurate , the digital time remaining shown next to it appears to be accurate .
__label__positive__ still going strong , its been more than an year when i brought it .
__label__neutral__ okay
__label__positive__ works perfect and inexpensive . could n't ask for more .
__label__positive__ it works very well
__label__positive__ kenneth was very very helpful . he made everything work after i spent hours , actually days , trying to get the 2 cameras up and working remotely . kenneth did it all in less than 10 minutes. < br / > when i first called foscam and the recording said i was # 27 in line and the wait would be 27 minutes , i almost hung up , but it was worth the wait . kenneth gave me back my sanity . between the port forwarding on my router and on the uverse modem i was going crazy , but its worth it just to call foscam support , they fixed it all .
__label__positive__ works great ! plug it into my laptop and upload my photos quick .
__label__positive__ this is a great tripod for the price . i 'm glad we got it .
__label__positive__ my husband the thrill seeker loves this chest mount ! his gopro was held securely while ziplining , mountain bike riding , and god knows what else he does : ) . great buy , should n't be disappointed .
__label__neutral__ not bad . built in mic is no good if you plan to record speeches or seminars but pic quality is ok and its easy to use .
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ worked great to watch a family senior moving about the house .
__label__negative__ images were not sharp at any distance , with and without a tripod . the original lens came with original kit was excellent . i am returning it .
__label__negative__ it is broken and does not work and no one has returned my calls to replace it . and my name is not richard , i am bj at bjdaneshfar @ gmail.com < br / > < br / > bjd
__label__positive__ very good quality and take a nice shot . this fits right on my iphone 6 and you do n't see any of the plastic parts in the picture once you get it set up . love that there is a macro and wide angle lens as well ! they screw together , but becareful because it 's pretty easy to get them cross-threaded . just do n't get in a hurry and you should be fine . the only thing i do n't like about it is it 's kind of bulky and heavy - not something you can leave on your phone and just carry around . the lenses themselves are pretty awesome though ! i just love getting macro shots in the spring when the wildflowers are in bloom ! it will be nice putting the wide angle on and getting the whole family in a couple of shots with a selfie stick too ! all in all , a very nice set up .
__label__positive__ careful , this is a 12 volt charger . clearly says that , but i over looker it . actually glad as it allows me to charge while riding. < br / > < br / > the charger is not the quality of the original , but works well and the battery is no different from the original. < br / > < br / > no problems with this and being 12 v gives me the excuse to buy the quick charger . not sure why i need it as i have 4 batteries .
__label__positive__ flawless .
__label__positive__ as expected
__label__positive__ quality glass that is still kicking on my camera a year later . i have nothing bad to say about this product . will buy again . a+
__label__positive__ comes it very handy . can clamp it to almost anything .
__label__negative__ quality is what you would expect for the price . i had to glue the air intake of the air puffer after the first use because it came off .
__label__negative__ lens failed to deploy .
__label__neutral__ i 'm giving only 3 stars because i have two main troubles with this product . i have a nikon d 3200 . i always use this lens attached to a 18-55 nikon /. < br / > 1- when i take pictures with the maximum wide , appears one shadow on each corner in the viewer and obviously in the picture . so before to take one picture in that way , i must check the corners in the viewer in order to avoid the shadows. < br / > 2-when i use the flash to take pictures to a closer object or person , appears the lens shadow on the picture . so i always must verify if the appears or not in the pic. < br / > on the other hand..the pictures are clear and there 's no less ligth in the picture and really increases the wide angle .
__label__positive__ works great . i use this with my kids 100 mm telescope . i found a piece of 3/4 inch thick packing foam , cut a circle to tightly fit the outside of the telescope , and glued the filter to the foam . we enjoy examining sunspots . compare what we see at spaceweather dot com .
__label__neutral__ so far it works well . my only complaint is that the cord is shorter than the original .
__label__positive__ i like them alot
__label__neutral__ i 'm sure this is a good camera but far too complicated for my needs . neither lens zoomed for close ups so i would have had to purchase another lens in order to take close ups of the wildlife i enjoy capturing . i am able to take better photos with my older canon powershot ! i was very disappointed but amazon was great about my returning the camera for a prompt refund .
__label__positive__ good light for the money ,
__label__positive__ fascinating camera , yet a challenge to set up without a lot of trail and error. < br / > < br / > to setup the air : < br / > 1 . go to http : //www.getolympus.com/us/en/airconnect for a decent walk thru of setup actions with images. < br / > note that there are 3 layers on the camera back : the cell phone adapter layer with sm and lg switch , < br / > ( remove this layer by moving the release button on the side , the other release button is to release the lens < br / > on the camera front ) , the second layer with access to usb ( micro ) and the third layer ( there is < br / > a fine slot below the finger shown in the photo that is a slot for your fingernail to pry off the cover ) < br / > < br / > 2 . charging is done by usb , and battery life is modest. < br / > < br / > 3 . insert a micro sd card ( mine had error with ntfs , but exfat format worked ) into the slot on the third layer , turn on the wi-fi switch and the < br / > bluetooth switch ( 2nd layer ) . < br / > < br / > 4 . install and run the olympus air central app for android or ios phones and tablets and set up your wifi as requested in the app. < br / > < br / > that should get you going , a mechanical and software puzzle but fun to operate . my first use was macro , would like to also manual < br / > focus but have n't found a way yet . pretty easy to get your photos into computer by plugging in usb or remotely by emailing to your < br / > computer. < br / > < br / > 3 .
__label__negative__ works with my sony camcorder however does not work with my canon rebel t1i . the canon does not have the second hole on the bottom to attach it to the tripod base : (
__label__negative__ real bad but i guess u get what you pay for set it up in the car the frist day and ten mins in it stoped working check the sd card to see if it was all full but it had a lot of memory in it the so left it plugged in and 10 minutes later it died out and never worked . bad bad crap
__label__negative__ product did not keep the settings after several attempts to change them . did not want to order another in event problem still existed with a new one . looked cool though.. went with a different dash cam that has worked great .
__label__positive__ the battery arrived very quickly . i have n't used ut much yet , but it seems to be a very good quality and reasonably priced replacement for the canon battery . i am very satisfied with my purchase .
__label__positive__ the best way to carry and protect my phanton iii ... ..
__label__negative__ the pics and videos are in bad quality , it end up in the trash . save your money and do not pay it
__label__positive__ good quality . fits the basic accessories needed for my gopro .
__label__negative__ unfortunately , mine does n't work . but i was n't able to try it out until months had past . ( needed to buy a compatible flash . ) so never tried to return it . completely dead . no power . even with new batteries .
__label__positive__ as described .
__label__positive__ i purchased this filter kit for a lens that did not match it 's description . i purchased a 72mm kit when i actually needed 62mm filters . nevertheless , i decided to keep this kit as i assume i 'll be the owner of a 72mm diameter lens sometime in the future . based upon price , this is obviously an entry level filter kit perfect for someone like me , the very amateur photographer . besides the ever necessary uv and cpl filters , it has a nice assortment of macro filters plus a few accessories . the lens cap and leash < br / > are a nice touch . who has n't lost or misplaced a lens cap ? i also liked the idea of pouches to store and protect the filters . the vendor , goja shipped my order right away ensuring it arrived early or right on time . i would do business with this vendor again . [ [ asin : b00hs544ne 72mm professional lens filter and close-up macro accessory kit for canon ( ef 35mm f/1.4l , ef 85mm f/1.2l ii , ef 135mm f/2l ) , nikon ( 85mm f/1.4 , 18 200mm f/3.5 5.6g ) lenses - includes : vivitar filter kit ( uv , cpl , fld ) + vivitar macro close-up set ( +1 , +2 , +4 , +10 ) + tulip lens hood + center pinch lens cap + cap keeper leash + magicfiber microfiber lens cleaning cloth ] ]
__label__positive__ very nice for travel
__label__positive__ great glass for the money . ca n't beat vortex for quality versus price point .
__label__positive__ it was everything i expected
__label__positive__ works well for doing indoor shots of musical events . i used it handheld ( with its stability control ) and got good results . ( but , of course not as good as when using a mono or tri pod . ) < br / > < br / > i am pleased that the lens remains roughly the same length when being zoomed .
__label__positive__ works wonderfully ! exactly what i was looking for .
__label__neutral__ way too bulky . seems bm is not designed for the field or for hand-held shooting , but only for a studio environment . plate could be five times lighter and do the same job .
__label__positive__ no complaints !
__label__positive__ this product is too good to pass up . it ’ s easy to set up and very well designed . at this price it ’ s really a no brainer to get one . i have a canon 6d , 7d , and t3i and all of them work amazing on this .
__label__positive__ exactly what i hoped it 'd be !
__label__positive__ grate pics but kills the battery fast so get 2 .
__label__positive__ moose always delivers . love this circular polarizer . it is my second size and every time i get a lens , i will return to get one in the new size needed .
__label__negative__ m haaa a
__label__negative__ my review covers elk products . in 2009 we wanted a home automation system for a fully pre-wired 6500 square foot house , literally every door and window was pre-wired for alarms and thoughout the house cat 5 cables were installed to support integrated cameras and other devices . the builder 's choice of installers was recommending hai products or elk products . we chose elk . big mistake . first , the contracted installer went bankrupt before we purchased- no harm there . to find an installer we called elk , elk referred us their local representative . the representative gave us a few names . we selected one . they purchased most of the product from a company called smart home . now elk refuses to acknowledge smart home purchased products , same with amazon purchased . but do n't worry , that 's not why you should avoid elk with a 10 foot pole . we spend over $ 10,000 on our idiotic system . it was 100 % elk but with lights controlled by a different provider ( i 've since forgotten ) and thermostats were hai , because elk did n't yet have a smart thermostat . our installers ultimately went out of business . and only licensed installers have access to the brains of an elk system . we had modest level of control through the m1 but no where near enough . nor did we have authority to update the software , elk requires the authorized installer handle it . we called elk , they were helpless in finding us a replacement installer . i reached the original installers and they provided me with the codes for my system and wished me good luck . i actually successfully installed updated software and figured out how to re-program , change priorities etc . then we had a power problem , i could n't resolve it . i called the local representative . she told me she had many reports of the same problem and replacing the battery may resolve it . i replaced the battery and it did . by now several years had gone by and we wanted to add some wireless smoke detectors . wireless devices requires separate programming . the representative offered me classes . ultimately the only solution was to go to elk college . they have online seminars etc . but i did n't have the time . next the power unit went out . changing the power unit requires a level of security deeper than i had access to . i called for service . my local security company that monitors and maintains many systems said they would be happy to help , but they had no experience with elk . they were going to charge me hourly . i was literally looking at nearly a $ 1000 just for them to learn how to take-over a system since they did n't have access to the installer 's codes etc. , plus i had to pay for new power units and who know what else . meanwhile the lighing controls were failing so badly , that we had to re-wire all switches and & # 34 ; de-automate & # 34 ; them. < br / > being on a budget , i called around . i found out that time warner could take over my system for $ 200 , effectively replacing the power unit , battery etc and providing future maintenance. < br / > today i see that elk says they wo n't honor the warranties of products sold through smart home , yet they are ultimately the ones responsible for my purchasing from smart home . by the way , smart home is equally unsupportive . after i spent literally 200 % of the estimate , the installers left several unused elk products ; i asked if smart home would let me return them for a credit ; even with an email from the installers saying that it 's o.k . that they bought them for me , smart home refused to accept the merchandise .
__label__positive__ i love these caps ; they work very well and do n't get lost . i save my snazzy original caps for in the studio . i have to say the pinch is much easier to use and more secure that the original canon which can easily get knocked off the lens with a nudge . since i own several canon lenses with the same front end size , it only made sense to buy the 5 pack .
__label__positive__ this is a terrific value for anyone needing a remote shutter release for their camera . it is very simple , easy to use , and lightweight . i find the & # 34 ; wired & # 34 ; remotes to be more reliable than & # 34 ; wireless & # 34 ; when taking pictures . i have a wireless shutter release as well , and while the wireless gives me more freedom to move around , it has to pointed right at the sensor on the camera to work correctly. < br / > < br / > sure , the cord is only 48-ish inches , but it works every time . perfect for long or bulb exposures . it even allows you to press the shutter half-way to get the auto-focus and metering correct first . piece-o-cake .
__label__positive__ hard to remove batteries from charger . phoned to find out how to manipulate . put upward pressure on one side only . otherwise satisfactory . obviously better buy than oem .
__label__positive__ very sturdy tripod smart looking folds up tor easy carrying
__label__negative__ i was so excited about this product , but it would not sync with my camera . i tried over and over again and replaced the battery . nothing . : (
__label__positive__ item delivered on time , was as described
__label__positive__ all mentioned above was a1 as what it exactly said came to its expectation . though i was expecting that it could be used when taking a selfie using the front camera but nah .
__label__positive__ awesome ! i had no problems installing it and it seems to hold a charge much longer than the old one .
__label__positive__ i had the netgear vuezone system and upgraded to this one . upgraded does n't do it justice . the system is incredible ! the hd/waterproof cameras work anywhere in the house , which was n't the case before . i even have 2 of them outside . the hd picture is really sharp . the night shots are very clear and well lit . the first time i went back and looked at a video of my car pulling in the garage at night , i was blown away . you could see every detail in the darkness . the app that goes along with the system has obviously had a lot of work put into it . not only can you watch multiple cameras at once , you can zoom the live images and save them to your phone . while watching playbacks on the app , you no longer have to wait for the video to finish playing . you can skip to the next video just by flicking the video left or right . being able to have alerts sent to the app and/or email is very useful and comforting when i 'm away from home. < br / > < br / > i consider myself a video/gadget guru and i could not be happier ! smooth and easy-to-use are two words that come to mind when i think of my experience with this system .
__label__positive__ i ordered the expert shield and it was delivered in three days , that was with standard shipping , great service . the shield fits perfectly , could n't ask for a better fit . the price is very reasonable for this kind of quality. < br / > < br / > racinsailor
__label__positive__ fantastic
__label__positive__ replaced my 832 that died . works great .
__label__positive__ when used with various lowepro bags and their utility belt , this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders ( already an issue with two nikon dslrs ) .
__label__positive__ this product is made for professionals . it protects the camera entirely in most & # 34 ; wet & # 34 ; situations and it dries quickly . best of all is the price !
__label__positive__ great little lens for the price ! very sharp images . very well-built lens
__label__negative__ the top part of the tripod where the go pro screws on broke off the first time i used it . the plastic just stright up broke . if it had n't borken so easily the concept of the wraparound legs is great .
__label__positive__ this is an awesome bag and i highly recommend it. < br / > < br / > be careful , sometimes sellers , especially selling used items might claim they have the 638-319 bag but instead have an older tenba bag and not this model . make sure the bag you order has the vertical straps on the front to hold a tripod . there should also be a fold-out tripod cup at the bottom and there should be two velcro tripod straps included . the new model also has a removable hip belt . if these features are missing , you have an older bag. < br / > < br / > older models like the tenba 638-333 have none of these features . the 638-333 is also two inches taller than the tenba bag advertised here . here is an easy way to tell the difference . if your bag does n't have the vertical straps below the tenba label , you have the older model. < br / > < br / > the first picture is the older tenba roadie ii version , the second picture shows the new version with the vertical straps below the label .
__label__positive__ the lights work great !
__label__positive__ my cable run is over 200 feet and the picture quality is great
__label__positive__ very good product
__label__positive__ camera works great after dealing with d-link agent ( ar004636 ) . case id c6719807 . hazel was fantastic .
__label__positive__ pretty good , high quality fake camera . the blinking light is a bit much for my taste . once mounted , the fake wire definetely adds to the realism and the camera gives the look of having night vision as well . very believable !
__label__neutral__ got this as a replacement plate and it didn & # 34 ; t fit had to order a whole new ball head .
__label__positive__ exactly what i needed and workes great !
__label__positive__ good product . do n't use the cat5 cables that it comes with ! they will break easily on you . make sure to run your own cat5e or cat6 cables .
__label__positive__ working great ... excellent performance ...
__label__positive__ useful
__label__positive__ they are recharging great so far .
__label__positive__ works really well and has excellent directions and different file formats to choose from . professional quality for cheap .
__label__positive__ this is my first quad copter and no experience with a 4 channel controller . before this it was an rc car with a pistol grip controller with steering wheel . ( ~30 years ago ) it has been stuck in a 40+ foot tree , shaken and dropped from said tree , dropped from mid flight , and crashed a few times . i have yet to use the spare rotors that came with it or even put on the rotor guards . other than having to re-close the camera/battery compartment , the copter has taken it all without showing damage. < br / > the video camera is great for recording your flight to the top branch of a very tall tree and for aerial vistas but ( once you are on the ground ) do not zoom in too much as the clarity drops off quick . not sure what pixel count hd means but it gives fun pics and videos. < br / > durable fun copter ! !
__label__positive__ got this camera at a great discounted price and am very happy with it excellent night vision , very easy to set up for use with ipad .
__label__positive__ great price
__label__positive__ what power
__label__positive__ perfect for stashing my camera in my purse . i can walk around the city with it and no one knows i have an expensive camera in my bag .
__label__positive__ i was afraid that it wo n't well after reading some of the reviews , but it worked for me . i 'm using the neewer 160 led loaded with 6xaa batteries . the led unit is heavy and i was afraid that it will torque the clamp out of place , but the clamp held its grip well onto all of the places i 've out it ( lcd monitor , pvc pipes , metal frames , tripod leg , etc ) . the ball also locks well in all positions .
__label__positive__ high quality , reasonable price . highly recommended product .
__label__positive__ used them in the florida keys - worked perfect . kinda cheap feeling , just be cautious .
__label__positive__ really easy to set up . nice to access from smartphone or computer . the image and sound is delayed but i suppose that is to be expected . the sound is not very clear , kind of cuts in and out . but this was cheap and it seems to live up to its price point . if i got another camera i 'd probably spend a little more and get one that gives a wider viewing angle or one that can turn , as this camera has a very narrow view
__label__positive__ works great with nikon d3300 .
__label__positive__ it was a gift to my sister . i like its features but so far as i know she does not use it . apparently it requires more use of technology than she prefers , and is too bulky to carry in her purse like a gramma brag book .
__label__positive__ this camera is tiny . the menu system is a little confusing with its modes . there are some quirky things about which format you record in and how it stores and transfers these movies . but if you just take defaults and shoot with it , its pretty good . after reviewing the recorded movies on my computer , i 'd say the encoders are not great , just run of the mill. < br / > < br / > my only complaint with this package is the bag . the bag is just big enough to fit the camera and an extra battery , pretty much nothing else . i 've included pictures taken with my note3 to show the scale of both the camera and the bag .
__label__negative__ extremely flimsy . i had to use duct tape to help keep in place . completely eroded and i have n't had this item for more than five months . do not buy
__label__positive__ this is great compared to the color ones ! i use this mainly with my coronado solar telescope and the granulation on the sun looks incredible !
__label__positive__ we 'll made . good value .
__label__positive__ a definite improvement over the original bracket buttons , which i constantly had to retighten after only ten minutes of walking around . these buttons stay tight .
__label__positive__ we used this with our iphone on safari in africa and were pretty impressed with the images . does n't compare to an slr with a zoom lens , of course , but my son loved using this since he did n't have a big zoom camera . fun to share close-up images with those sitting around you too
__label__positive__ only one zipper , so they leak a little . i ordered them to hold down soccer pug 's , and they work great for that .
__label__positive__ there ai n't nothing like an original part . working great !
__label__positive__ i bought this to use as a plein air easel for watercolor painting . i 'm still in the process of getting my attachments set up for it so i have n't used it outside yet . for the price , it seems stable , lightweight and has all the features i needed .
__label__positive__ lost my official sony charger . bought this one hoping . the product works great . the plastic is very cheap feeling and i am a bit concerned about the tiny plastic nub that holds the batter in place , but so far so good . the fold down 120vac is a nice touch . the european and car charger make this a very nice all around to use package . but it to charge your camera battery .
__label__positive__ the typhoon yuneec q500+ has a superior camera/video . it comes with its own fpv screen , an extra battery , a handheld steady grip for the cgo+ camera , and an aluminum case . the whole package only cost me only $ 1249.00 . delivery was very prompt ( less than a week ) . < br / > < br / > the typhoon is an extremely stable aerial photography platform , thanks to a dual gps-glonass positioning system . even when it is much bigger than the other competitor quadcopters , it has a well engineered and aerodynamic design . wind gusts will flow gracefully around the quadcopter body . the cgo+ 3 axis gimbal camera is very light and shaped as a ball . thus the whole quadcopter feels very light , even when it is awkward to handle because of its size. < br / > < br / > the quadcopter will bind with the sto+ transmitter very fast . for the competitor quadcopters , it will require more time to set up wifi and binding before you can send the quadcopter in the air . also the sto+ transmitter is the only one in the market with its own gps-glonass system , allowing the quadcopter to return to where the transmitter is located , rather where it takes off .
__label__positive__ nice strong transmitter would buy again
__label__positive__ lasts longer than generic
__label__positive__ works good in the dark but will shut off in the light . did not know when buying but was an added bonus . just something to keep an eye out for .
__label__positive__ quick delivery and no problems with the pack , just no lens cleaner fluid as others have already said hence 4stars
__label__positive__ great deal ! got this as a gift for my dad and he loved it ! everything as described .
__label__positive__ this is a great product not only for camera lenses . they can also be used for other electronic device .
__label__positive__ i was expecting a gopro brand one for the price i paid but it 's still a good purchase
__label__positive__ this frame looks nice and has a high-quality picture that i feel good about having guests see when they visit our home . i like it enough that i have bought nix frames for friends and family. < br / > however , the long-term durability is not great . i have had two frames that have gone dead . not just not-working dead , but so profoundly dead that the power button was fused into one position . nix customer service is always very helpful and has replaced both frames quickly and easily , even after the warranty had expired , so that was good . i just wish i had n't had to have the frames replaced in the first place .
__label__positive__ as described and work well
__label__positive__ a must try product !
__label__positive__ wow ! if you 're even remotely considering protecting your lcd screen , ( and why would n't you be ) , this is the deal for you . i was using that plastic stick-on sheet stuff and never could figure out why my shots were sharp , but did n't appear so on the lcd screen . the plastic is slightly frosted , probably due to method that holds it to the screen.. this item displays the shots & # 34 ; clear-as glass & # 34 ; ( pun intended ) . i 'm super glad i bought this item . just a note : when you remove the thin plastic protector , you 're not ready to mount it yet . you need to carefully ( it 's super thin ) peel the white protective border from the backside , and do n't touch what it is protecting - you have oils on your fingers . follow this and position the unit with care and you too will be impressed . oh yes , and of course , need i say , clean your lcd screen prior to mounting this unit - duuh !
__label__negative__ almost half of the film that i received came out blank . i know that sometimes there can be lighting errors and i realize this and they are not to blame for this , however the ones that i am having trouble are ones that show nothing at all . they simply did n't work . i know it 's not a camera error and i do n't think this deal is worth it because i would rather pay and not receive this offer and get all films that work and not that come out empty . i was really upset at how many films i had to throw away because they did n't come out not to mention on the moments that i thought i captured and missed . i was really disappointed .
__label__positive__ arrived quickly and works like a charm
__label__positive__ wonderful product , very pleased .
__label__positive__ the lens arrived on time and in excellent condition . it is a great portrait lens . i am very pleased with the clarity of the photos produced with the sony sel18/b 50mm lens .
__label__negative__ junk . broke in first hour . do n't waste your money .
__label__positive__ if you have a gopro - you need at least 10 batteries . i forgot that you also need at least 4 -6 battery chargers as it takes 2 hours to charge . you need at least 1/2 as many chargers as you have batteries . for those who use the go pro a lot , you all know it dies in short a time and right at that real important shot. < br / > < br / > i bought 3 different types this time - ill be checking each one out to see which is best .
__label__negative__ the arm are not very flexible , hard to bend ... .
__label__positive__ heavy duty and well made . makes life so much easier .
__label__positive__ always good to have an extra battery ... and here you get two batteries and a great charger . never leave without a backup fully charged battery when going to shoot your awesome pictures .
__label__positive__ product was as described and arrived very quickly . batteries work just fine in canon powershot sx60 too. < br / > thank you .
__label__negative__ major trouble with electronics in camera , needs to be sent out for repair
__label__negative__ changed my review . after 6 months in service , plus 2 months to figure out how to install it , i am not happy . the wifi connection is intermittent - works and after a few days suddenly find out it is not connected to handset via wifi . then trying to reconnect is a bitch ( again ) . cameras are great - quality is superior - recording equally fine . but the damn wifi makes the system fail - repeatedly . for this money , once installed , i do n't expect any intermittent or routine problems . given the chance , i would find something else .
__label__positive__ these sensors work very well . installed 3 of them and getting ready to install 3 more .
__label__neutral__ this review is for a samsung galaxy s4 under 4.2.0 on the technical side. < br / > < br / > you know , i am the kind of person that hates phones where everything has to be touch screen . sure it provides some pros , but nothing beats having physical buttons over touch buttons. < br / > < br / > well , this product is perfect for me , right ? it should be 5 stars , right ? wrong. < br / > < br / > for starters let me say that the button placement is pretty bad , and being such a small device does n't help on the matter. < br / > < br / > from the screenshots you 'd think this controller would be somewhat big , but in reality is extremely small , just at 2 inches long . this is a huge problem with people with medium to big hands . if you have big hands i 'd say avoid this product. < br / > < br / > the problems comes , like i said earlier , in the button placement . on the sides of the control you have the volume buttons to the right side while the next/back buttons are on the left side. < br / > < br / > normally you 'd hold your control with your thumb on the right side to get a good grip but guess what ? the volume buttons are there and if you hold it in the traditional way by the time you try to press next or back you 'd also be lowering or making louder your music. < br / > < br / > to fix this you have to grab the controller in pretty weird ways if you want to avoid pressing the volume buttons simultaneously while pressing back or forward . granted , none of them are uncomfortable but there should be no excuse to hold this control like any other type of remote. < br / > < br / > something minor on the subject of the side buttons is that for some odd reason , while holding the unit frontally , the forward button is down and the back button is on top . makes no sense . for comparison , the volume up is on top and volume down on the bottom . smooth logical thinking. < br / > < br / > there is enough space below the play/pause button to place the back and forward buttons and leave the volume on the sides . but it seems having that chunk of unused space was necessary to plaster the logo. < br / > < br / > oh and by the way , this thing is not universal . in order to select android or iphone you have a switch at the very top to select which device you 'll be using . nothing really major but worth noting . however , on the back of the unit there is a sticker ( yes , an actual sticker ) that indicates what device you 're using . not only is it of bad quality it does n't even fit right on the device . the sticker extends a little to the sides of the control. < br / > < br / > that was one rating star right there , the next star comes from the functionality. < br / > < br / > i am not sure if my device came defective or if this is common issue but : < br / > < br / > - sometimes the control stops responding entirely. < br / > - i am aware that in order for \\ '' keyboards\\ '' to work properly you have to be on the right app , in this case the music player. < br / > - even with the music player at full screen the control would not respond at all. < br / > - holding the play button would bring the open apps tab , meaning the control was still connected and obviously responding to my presses. < br / > - but for some odd reason it just would n't work to play my music. < br / > - pressing play and pause on the phone would magically make the control work back again. < br / > - when you lock your screen , droid phones have pattern security , and a small space on top for a widget , in my case the music player. < br / > - on the lock screen and while the phone is on , pressing play on the control will highlight the pattern zone , as if you were trying to unlock the device , ignoring completely the music player widget. < br / > < br / > in comparison , my car 's bluetooth controls work perfectly . they only stop working when i am not in the music app , the home screen or the lock screen . anywhere else like an internet explorer they wo n't work , but that 's to be expected . but my point still stands , they never stop responding like this control does. < br / > < br / > all in all the idea is amazing , but really bad executed . i think this control is more like a test product to see if there is enough demand for physical controls . which should be . but at the end of the day , it fails in so many ways that your only hope is for a real brand to design a much better control .
__label__positive__ perfect
__label__positive__ works well with a speedlite flash
__label__positive__ perfect .
__label__positive__ i like this better than the round version because it does n't cause vignetting and because of the shape , it 's easier to figure out which way to mount it . it 's sturdy and light .
__label__positive__ knocks down the flash intensity nicely for the price
__label__negative__ funny thing . as i was presented with the opportunity to review this by amazon , it was sitting in front of me on my desk. < br / > < br / > i am a careful handler of cameras and lenses . i have never broken a camera or lens . this one stopped working and whern i brought it to the camera repair place they told me it was non-functional and would cost too much to repair it . i had to buy a different one . i would never buy this again .
__label__positive__ i purchased this to use with my canon t3i camera. < br / > so far , i have had no issues with it ! it works as intended , with me using the shutter release button more than the timer function . i use it to minimize shake when doing night photography with a long exposure. < br / > i have owned it for about a year now , and the battery is still going strong , with only sporadic use. < br / > i have only played around with the time lapse timer function a couple of times , and have had no problems with it . it works like it 's supposed to , so it is perfect for what i need it for !
__label__positive__ a best product . well constructed . compact but plenty of room for two cameras ( canon 7d and m3 bodies ) , four lenses , flash and macro flash , with plenty of room left over for all the small accessories . lots of dividers , sections , and pockets .
__label__positive__ works well , no problems there . however the button to take the photos is not at a place where my thumb can reach it . i can not find a way to fix this and it 's extremely annoying to press it with my forefinger . update : the grip also shifts around . so if you 're pressing where the button says it is and nothings happening , try moving the grip around or pressing outside of where the button is supposed to be .
__label__positive__ does what it says , easy to apply . no harm caused to muffins .
__label__positive__ i bought this when i went cave diving and it worked perfectly . the giant floaty is easy to spot when it floats in the ocean , a creek , or a cave and it holds the weight of the gopro very well. < br / > < br / > it comes with a double sided sticky adhesive and a spare back case door , so that you can take the door off when you are n't planning to use the gopro in the water . there are two spare case doors included , one large and one small depending on which size gopro and gopro case you have .
__label__positive__ works well with my x-t1 .
__label__positive__ i picked this up as a spare for my 2015 yamaha v1 waverunner . it is is comfortable and seems to be a much better quality than the one that came with my unit . this has replaced the original as my primary lanyard .
__label__neutral__ bought this 2 times within 6 months and it has broke within a couple weeks . not reliable . if you pull it out too far it will come apart .
__label__neutral__ worked great for about a month until it randomly broke . very upset about this product . it would have been a great product had it actually been reliable and not easily breakable .
__label__negative__ setup way to complicated for the average user .
__label__neutral__ cheaper than i thought it was bestowed board feeling and the box it came in was damaged so when i opened it the case was a little dented and i had to attempt to pop it out and mostly it worked there was a crease left . it really does n't seem like it would protect my camera .
__label__positive__ if you wear glasses , you might want to think twice about this eyecup . i do wear glasses and remove them when i 'm using the camera , when i 've taken care of all of the settings etc. , you know , when i 'm actually framing the photo . i 've kept the one that came with the camera if by chance i decide to use it . still in the tryout stage . do appreciate that it cuts out the light trying to come in from the side .
__label__positive__ perfect to keep track of lens cap when taking pics . at first did n't want to order since so many in package , but have shared with friends and now i added another lends so i can see using these over time .
__label__positive__ they are & # 34 ; wireless & # 34 ; ... .but they do n't run on batteries ! ( wow ) - of course they need a plug to have & # 34 ; power from electricity & # 34 ; ! < br / > < br / > these are & # 34 ; monitors & # 34 ; ... not secret spy cameras ! ! ( lol )
__label__positive__ these mounts increase the gopro 's options and versatility by ten fold .
__label__positive__ it 's awesome !
__label__negative__ unit worked once then quit working. < br / > new egg and manufacturer failed to refund or replace defective product after many requests . new egg passed responsibility to china company who has not refunded for product. < br / > rip offs
__label__positive__ i find this action camera amazing and very compact thats capable of taking great quality videos and pictures . i was super excited to receive the polaroid polc3 cube hd digital video action camera camcorder ( blue ) . the camera is 1.4 inches by 1.4 inches by 1.4 inches cube shaped and weighs 1.66 ounces . it comes with a charging cable and the camera when charged fully will record video for 90 minutes.the high quality 6 mp camera takes excellent 720 p and 1080 p video . you can switch between the resolution via switch inside the circular cover on one side which can be removed to charge the camera and pit the sd card . this cover is water resistant cover that you can remove with a coin .under the lens on the front of the camera there is a microphone to record what is going on . the sound and video recording are superb . its has a very elaborate instruction manual which was easy to understand.under the camera there is a magnetic mount for attaching the camera to a car , or anything magnetic ..i do it on my bicycle and it stays without any issues while riding the bike.there is a multifunction button on the top of the camera and as instructed if you press it for 3 seconds the led will turn green and the unit is on . a single press takes a photo and a double press starts the video recording . when you are recording a video a single press of the button stops the recording.if you plug the camera into your computer you will see a piece of software called polaroidcube and that allows you to make some adjustments to the cameras settings . a folder called dcim contains your recorded videos and photos . charge the camera using your computer 's usb port or use an usb ac wall power source or usb car charger that outputs.i wish it also included the 32 gb sd card too . since i had one from another camera i was able to test this product.overall i am so excited to use this product and it gives amazing quality video and pictures. < br / > sample provided to test and provide my unbiased reviews .
__label__negative__ i own for about 3 years as a working proi . i boughy for underwater stils and video . it is a decent walk around camera , images are sharp and i have had some great images . since my main purpose in getting the camera was to to capture underwater video , the camera is a major disappointmemt . camera overheats on video in 3 minutes and shuts down . unforgiveable . this is a consistent from camera to camera , and the fix was a modification to the bios to give a message warning you about the overheating . i expect much better from sony i also find focusing to be extremely slow ,
__label__negative__ the clicking sound is too loud . returned .
__label__positive__ this plate is as good as the original manfrotto plate at a fraction of the cost . it also fits perfectly , not too tight and not too sloppy .
__label__positive__ i 'm brazillian and my english is not good , but it 's all ok with my purchase : ) < br / > thanks
__label__positive__ great quality tripod for the price . the carrying bag is a nice addition . the head can adjust vertically , rotate , and tilt . there is also a small bubble level to ensure your camera is leveled . you wo n't be doing any intense cinematography with it , but for the average user it offers everything you could want !
__label__positive__ the pics are clear and it has plenty of options . i was a little disappointed but 360 view in a half sphere is pretty neat . it 's a fun little toy .
__label__positive__ this camera performs well under water. < br / > i used it to shoot underwater in the pool and it performed like a champ. < br / > needless to say , it more than hold its own outside during a thunderstorm and wet environment. < br / > keep an extra battery because the battery wo n't last long if you incorporate video activities in your shoots .
__label__neutral__ i find it hard to use , personally . it 's not intuitive at all , and i 'm good with electronics .
__label__positive__ after getting a new telescope , i realized i would need finer eyepieces . i started out getting a 10mm and realized i wanted higher magnification . i purchased this 4mm because it was the cheapest option and that logic did not fail me . of course , some details were skipped . the metal is cheap and the glass has some fringing on the outside , but really the pros are better than the cons . i recommending taking off the eye relief plastic , and you will be able to get a closer look at the 4mm glass. < br / > < br / > now , for amateurs , a smaller mm eyepiece usually means higher magnification . this is only really neccessary for lunar and planetary views . for most dsos , a 15mm or 20mm is needed .
__label__neutral__ to get it out of the way , i purchased the anart spc-08 to compare it against the dbpower sj4000 , which was sent to me for review purposes . originally , the anart model was being labeled as an sj4000 as well , but i 'm glad to see that anart has chosen to stop attempting to fool people into thinking the spc-08 is anything more than a clone of an sj4000 . it 's definitely not and sj4000 . the dbpower model on the other hand is up in the air . the packaging did n't have the special seal a new and authentic sj4000 has , but , it did have sj4000 firmware installed and i was able to update it to a newer version by following the instructions provided on the sj4000 site . both before and after , the dbpower unit also worked with the official sjcam app for android . in theory , this means it 's a real sj4000 that has been rebranded , a not unheard ofpractice . but , i for one wo n't call it a sure thing . the only difference i noted before and after the upgrade is that the dbpower boot-up logo was replaced with the sjcam logo with the new firmware. < br / > < br / > anyhow , back to the comparisons . in terms of price , there is n't much difference , just ten bucks at the time of this writing . both come with pretty much the same amount of kit , and can work with most every gopro accessory out there . i found the buttons on the waterproof case for the dbpower to be stiffer and harder to actuate than the anart 's version , but perhaps that will loosen up over time . between the manuals , the dppower is n't perfect , but a cut above the anart when it comes to what 's included and the typical sore points - grammar and proper english . both have an app , though the anart worked on both android 4.x and 5.x , while the sjcam app refused to work with 5.x android . the menu setup , controls , and capabilities of each are more or less that same , with one major difference . the anart does time lapse photography , while the dbpower does time lapse video . myself , i prefer the dbpower 's time lapse video , though one can take the anart 's time lapse photos and combine them into a movie . ( one can also break up the frames of the dbpower 's movie into images . ) in time trials , neither model seemed better or worse than the other when it came to battery life , image/video clarity , or data transfer speeds . something that did show up is the wifi power . the anart had a difficult time communicating at ranges over 2-3 feet ( at the end of a selfie stick ) , far less than it should be . the dbpower on the other hand worked just fine across distances up to 100 feet ( it may work farther , but i did n't test it ) . < br / > < br / > so i 've had these both for over two months , and neither has died out . i offered my housemate his pick of which he would like to have , after getting quality time in with each - he chose the anart , citing the menu system made more sense to him . for myself , was happy to have the dbpower instead , as i think it is the superior of the two , if for nothing more than the wifi works reliably at longer distances.e the anart 's time lapse photos and combine them into a movie .

__label__positive__ excellent , fast , exactly as described ! ! ! thank you
__label__positive__ it is an excellent lense for our new sony camera .
__label__positive__ omg this is just what i expected an more ! great conatruction , great materials ! smooth and simple ! amazing ! ! ! ! if you do n't buy this as your first tripod you are just dumb !
__label__positive__ i already used it on my glasses and on my tv screen and it does what it promises . great product. < br / > will recommend this product
__label__positive__ i had to replace my babies r us baby camera after the charging port had issues . this was a perfect buy ! for under $ 60 i am able to monitor my sleeping baby , and sometimes use it to check on the house when i 'm out . it connects to your local wifi and streams the video thru an app you can download on your phone or tablet . i have apps on both in case grandma is watching the baby and i have to leave the house and take my phone with me. < br / > easy to setup ( took me about 20 minutes ) . has day and mode . picks up audio. < br / > the only thing i do n't like about it is the indicator light that my daughter keeps noticing when the lights in the room are turned off . it is yellow and blinks when streaming and steady when not streaming. < br / > i think it is worth mentioning that if your router is close to your microwave , the streaming signal does get disrupted when the microwave is being used . it causes the picture to freeze or lag . microwave disrupts any electronic that has signal , it did it to my babies r us monitor receiver as well . but i 'd your router is not anywhere near your microwave , you should be fine .
__label__positive__ quick service ! great product ! thank you
__label__positive__ my rating : 4.5/5 stars < br / > < br / > was looking for a dpf for the office and wanted something that was fairly simple and yet with decent screen quality . the micca 10.1 unit is a very nice unit . there 's no firmware to update . the menus are not overly complex . the layout is generally ok an the included remote is a nice touch if you want to place it on a far shelf. < br / > < br / > the screen quality is very good . it has a 1024x600 resolution and will automatically fit your pictures ; however , this is not a default setting . be sure to change this in the settings menu. < br / > < br / > one feature that i really like is the auto on/off feature based on time of day . this is handy for the office environment. < br / > < br / > the only negative that i have encountered once so far is the unit can get stuck in a loop on certain pictures . i have approximately 50 photos loaded up on a 16gb sdhc card . the card has been formatted fat32 as per the instructions . i started the unit in slideshow mode and after about an hour , i noticed that only certain pictures were coming up . i fixed this by going into the settings menu and changing from slideshow mode to photo mode . photo mode just displays pictures and slideshow will do pictures and music . since i 'm just using it for photos then it made sense to use the photo mode . since doing so , the loop issue has n't reproduced. < br / > < br / > tip # 1 : to save some storage memory , you can use a program like microsoft paint to resize a 16:9 photo from it 's original resolution ( which is usually very high ) down to 1024x600 . paint will resize and keep the pictures aspect ratio so that it wo n't look goofy . if you have a large memory card ( 16gb or greater ) then this really is n't necessary . resizing can save gobs of storage space however . a typical example : an original digital camera photo could be 3mb in size and after the change it could be only 300kb. < br / > < br / > tip # 2 : if you do n't like the stretchy effect of 1024x600 then be sure to set the vertical resize value to 600 and paint will fill in the horizontal value automatically < br / > < br / > tip # 3 : the micca instruction booklet is not very detailed . to make sure your photos are in proper sequence you have to use filenames that & lt ; 8 characters in total . example : img01 , img02 , img03 , img04 , etc. < br / > < br / > update : a month later i have n't had a single issue with my unit . i think the key is to keep the filename short . also , i have found that the best picture version to be using tip # 2 . re-size pictures to a vertical height of 600 and let your software fill in the horizontal value . this is especially good if your camera uses a 16:9 ratio . 4:3 or 3:2 ratios will be smaller but will still look just fine .
__label__positive__ just what i asked for a no bulk case - i 'm still trying to get used to it but , so far so good .
__label__negative__ too hard / time consuming to work correctly ! i 'm thinking about returning it ! !
__label__positive__ delivered to my grand daughter in another state .
__label__positive__ good camera system . simple to install
__label__positive__ very good overall , just the battery life is poor.should use aa battery
__label__negative__ no directions , crappy connector for the camera that failed upon first careful insertion and separated from the flimsy circuit board . my gopro camera fried upon first connection . not only is this product absolutely terrible , 3dr does not answer the phone or respond to emails . i 'm done with 3dr . i have been robbed .
__label__negative__ i 've been shopping on amazon for several years now and have never been more unhappy with a purchase . i could blast this product in ten thousand words or more but will keep this brief for my sanity and yours . firstly , your sanity will be more than tested by the lack of functionality these cameras produce . trying to control them with either the pc software or the ios app is next to impossible . they do not respond to commands 80 % of the time and when they do , they & # 34 ; over-steer & # 34 ; to a ridiculous degree . trying to use the alarm recording and video capture associated with it is futile ; this has never worked correctly . i do have two of these units , both are identical ... garbage x2 . i should point out that i 've tried a multitude of other software packages and none identified these cameras . additionally , i want to mention that i have high quality network equipment as well as a 10mb+ internet connection .
__label__positive__ amazing ! love it !
__label__positive__ we use nest camera 's for research purposes and love this product . other foscam products do n't have nearly the software development that dropcam , now nest , puts into their recording software . the video quality is great . setup is perfect . love it .
__label__negative__ i order this product two times before , and i return them cause simply it was defective , first one it has dust particles under screen ( imagine new camera out of the box with some dust particles under screen ? ? ? ) , also second one it has same problem plus problem with view finder . then i order the third camera cause i like the sony hx series and specially long zoom pocket camera , i receive it yesterday it has many issues , first is not detecting the wireless ? ? ? , focus issues , also when i turn camera on it keep showing me error & # 34 ; turn the camera off then on again & # 34 ; ? ? ? , and the quality of the product is terrible and the way they finished the plastic is so flimsy . i had sony hx20v and hx50v before it was much better and even the body was plastic too , but it was much tougher , also the overall quality is bad . i gon na return this one too . i like the sony hx series and i had them long time ago , but after buying the flimsy plastic hx90v , not just the plastic but it not functioning well , i have to look for other compact zoom camera . so do n't waste your time and money .
__label__positive__ this monopod supports my heave lens and camera without any problem i also use the sirui aluminium tilt head l-10 .
__label__positive__ works good
__label__negative__ i have had this camera for 2.5 years now . pentax cameras are renowned for their dust and water sealing - but make sure to read the fine print ! this camera is not dust/water sealed , and you can ruin it by mistreating it. < br / > < br / > for the price , this is a great camera . it has a lot of features that my k10d did n't , such as interval shooting , and video . however , recently it has developed a problem with the aperture control . every photo i take is underexposed the first time , and will be properly exposed the second photo i take . after reading up online i 've narrowed it down to the magnets that control the aperture - a common problem among k-30s apparently . unfortunately my camera is now out of warranty , and ricoh would like to charge me a minimum of $ 160 to repair it , plus shipping . that 's almost as much as the body is worth , so it looks like i now have a second pentax paperweight . i can still use it with my manual aperture lenses , but as i 've already purchased a 35mm and a 50mm autofocus , it kind of defeats the purpose. < br / > < br / > if you 're going to get a pentax , go with a mid/high level one . stay away from the cheaper ones as they are not up to the same quality as the rest of pentax 's offerings .
__label__negative__ got it broken . seller wo n't refund or respond . piece of crap and waste of $ 50 . made in china .
__label__positive__ awesome , all together makes a great selfie pole . adds more dynamic views for your gopro/camera . the only thing i wish was that the on button would extend throughout the pole , so that i dont have to take the pole off and on to turn on the stabilizer . but overall , this is a great lightweight pole extention .
__label__positive__ works great .
__label__positive__ i like it
__label__positive__ ca n't wait to buy more of this item ! !
__label__positive__ excellent camera . minor hiccup in getting wrong charging cord but was refunded for that .
__label__positive__ i bought two of the new hero+ lcd cameras to replace my aging hero hds that i use on my vintage formula vee race car . the performance of the new cameras is very good , i 'm now shooting my footage at 1080p 60fps and over the last two race weekends had zero issues with dropped frames and the picture quality is a big improvement over my old heros. < br / > < br / > one thing i did n't realize when i ordered these was that they are sealed units , you ca n't replace the battery or replace the external casing , the camera is permanently mounted within the protective housing . if i had known i might have popped for the next model up , since it is easy to get a scratch on the protective case cover in auto racing ( lots of stuff gets thrown about on a racetrack ! ) and it 's a lot more economical to replace a $ 15 housing than a $ 299 camera . i should have read the product descriptions more closely. < br / > < br / > also the battery life of the hero+ lcd is about half of that of my old hero hds , and i learned that the hard way when we had three races in one day and i did n't even think to check the battery levels ( which had started the day fully charged ) but then found that both cameras had died half-way through the third race . my old heros would make it through an entire race weekend without needing a recharge ( and i had extra batteries just in case , not possible with the new model ) . < br / > < br / > but now that i know that i can use a portable usb charger to top off the cameras between races so they 're always 100 % , just an extra step i never had to worry about before . for the money i 'm very happy with the picture quality so hopefully the housings will last the life of the cameras themselves and be a non-issue .
__label__negative__ charger works for existing battery , but new batter , though same number will not work in camera
__label__positive__ fit well . would purchase again
__label__positive__ you ca n't go wrong with these cases . they 'll last a lifetime .
__label__positive__ lots of pockets . sturdy . more details after we travel out of country with it .
__label__negative__ sorry to say that the cameras usb port came off as my son tried to plug in the connection to charge the batteries . we bought it on the aug.5 and it broke aug 19 . but it does take wonderful videos .
__label__positive__ it does what they said it will do . no problem with it .
__label__positive__ my girlfriend has been begging for a 'fashion ' strap for her cannon t3 rebel for years now and i finally smartened up and invested in one- only problem ? now she wants more cam-in straps ! i noticed , when shopping , that designed straps can range upwards of $ 90 , especially the scarf style she 's been eying , so i was unsure how this , more traditional , strap would go over with her . at $ 20 , it seemed like a bargain , and this style in particular was very colorful and kitschy , which matches her all around. < br / > < br / > *the strap arrived in a very basic semi-translucent plastic packaging and the strap itself had some branding imprinted on the brown leather straps. < br / > < br / > *the packaging included basic instructions , to install the strap , and conversion hardware ( two matching leather tabs and round brackets ) for older cameras , or newer polaroids such as the fujifilm instax mini 8 . if you have a dslr then you likely installed the original straps- these go on very much in the same way so instructions were not needed , but are nice to have . we really though the extra touch of conversion hardware was of great value- it 's nice to know these straps can add beauty to a wide variety of cameras. < br / > < br / > *the length of this strap ( excluding the adjustable nylon straps ) was about 2 inches longer than our standard cannon t3 rebel strap . in all , it offered about 4 inches of extra length when installed and at maximum length. < br / > < br / > *the width of the strap itself if the same consistently through to the more narrow nylon strap- unlike the traditional cannon dslr straps , which are wider at the neck for more even weight distribution . the interior of this fashion strap is also made with a uniform material- unlike the stock/traditional cannon strap , which has a rubberized grip coating at the widest , central , point . noting these things , this strap is beautifully constructed and well made . the interior material is a soft suede material that adds a richness to the design and wear we truly appreciate. < br / > < br / > *the detailing of the woven design is quite well done , and the colors are very vibrant and rich . my girlfriend is in love with the strap , despite the fact she initially thought she 'd wanted something with a primary black base . in the end , she says that this strap has a great vintage vibe that pays homage to traditional photography , and she does n't mind the contrast of brown to black at all . i received a product discount in exchange for my honest thoughts on this product.reciate. < br / > < br / > *the detailing of the woven design is quite well done , and the colors are very vibrant and rich . my girlfriend is in love with the strap , despite the fact she initially thought she 'd wanted something with a primary black base . in the end , she says that this strap has a great vintage vibe that pays homage to traditional photography , and she does n't mind the contrast of brown to black at all . i received a product discount in exchange for my honest thoughts on this product .
__label__negative__ worked great but it had a cheap connection that broke off
__label__positive__ this son of a b**** ... bought this for my wife when we were expecting our first child . the videos it records are crystal clear and have never had trouble getting them on the computer . this thing has been through it all . it 's been a child chew toy , rattle , shake weight , rob gronkowski football and a bowling ball . still runs perfectly ... ... ... but kinda obsolete thanks to phones , but fun thing to give to your kids as their first go-pros .
__label__positive__ everything my husband wanted ! he loves it !
__label__positive__ good camera , good price easy to use
__label__positive__ i love this and perfect for when you have a photoshoot solo . a little bit heavy for me when i have to hold it with one hand but i have small hands : )
__label__positive__ great camera when you need an extra body and already have lenses and flash . i use this when i dont want to haul around my d100 . great shipment time - i will be back to amazon .
__label__positive__ have been reading reviews on this product for a while . when i saw this certified refurbished price i decided to try it for myself . the setup was surprisingly easy . i must say having a background in computers and networking was a plus for me . once configured , i played with it around the house to get familiar with the device and the software application for controlling the camera . i am the audio engineer for a church so that 's where i would be testing and using this camera out on ustream . using a windows laptop . i was able to control the camera and stream live with no issues . for what i intend to use the camera for , this is the best device on the market . i will use this camera and possibly several more of the same model . i could see where setup could be tricky if you do n't know about networking , because this camera is strickly a wifi device once setup is complete . great job by amazon and the seller , no issues with shipping and product arrived in great condition . i may update my review after more use . so far so good .
__label__positive__ i have gotten many compliments on how professional this bag is . great organization ! worth every penny !
__label__positive__ extremely well made case , it will be perfect for our camera equipment . i would highly recommend this case , it is very tough !
__label__positive__ this alarm is still going strong after 5 years without any issues . installed in 06 nissan tiida .
__label__positive__ very cool ... i had to have my son get it set up for me as i am not well versed in these things , but ... .i have been able to monitor my house while on vacation ! i get alerts whenever someone goes in ( even my 'house sitters ' ) and have video surveillance of all activity . great stuff .
__label__positive__ must have item for groups shots of the family - works fine < br / > buy 2 you well lose one
__label__negative__ it does n't work as advertised . i can still see the green light beam from my nest camera. < br / > it requires a usb to usb cable be plugged into the back and then to a usb charger . the cable they provided is very short so i ca n't place it where i wanted too without adding a long power strip. < br / > installation was difficult . the instructions do n't mention screwing off the metal stand of the nest camera . when mounting the camera you push it in until the 2 tabs on the camera & # 34 ; click & # 34 ; into the clock . that took about 10 minutes and dozens of tries because it kept popping out after i had firmly clicked it. < br / > i 'm keeping it because i do n't see anything else advertised and it may still full someone who thinks it 's just a clock .
__label__positive__ excellent- perfectly converted my tripod to swiss arca
__label__positive__ purchased this gift for my dad who fancies himself as a photographer . they charge and work just like the one that came with the camera and he 's excited to use his backup battery to photograph summer vacations .
__label__negative__ show a great pic..just had a line on one side , this was suppose to be a new item , but i think it was a use item , maybe or maybe not..but great pic on oneside .
__label__positive__ holds like iron . pleased .
__label__positive__ good product .
__label__positive__ fits well on my lens
__label__positive__ i attached this permanently to my roof rack on my 4-runner to store recovery ropes , straps , etc . in . the build is the typical quality you expect from pelican except for the fact that the padlock locations are not metal reinforced like with my other pelican cases . the lack of metal reinforcement is particularly ironic because this is intended to be used as a gun case and a few industrious moments with a sharp pocketknife would gain you access . i guess pelican saved .25 cents and is in a race to the bottom like many companies who lower standards and quality .
__label__positive__ item as described . used as a gift . good buy !
__label__positive__ wife loves it .
__label__positive__ this backpack holds the phantom 3 professional with propellers detached without a problem . i can carry 3 batterys easy in the build in compartments and a 4th next to the charger . highly recommend it .
__label__positive__ perfect , even sturdier than the original !
__label__positive__ the top latch is difficult to work at first & comes apart sometimes , but otherwise works great for what i needed ( to use external mic )
__label__positive__ surprised by the quality of these lamps . perfect for table top photography .
__label__positive__ the charger arrived promptly and does what it is supposed to do , so all is good .
__label__positive__ fit great !
__label__positive__ i absolutely love this product ! i use it for a pet cam to see , talk , n hear my fur baby 's . so easy to set up . worth the money in my opinion .
__label__positive__ excellent bundle . i had the same issue as stelios is another review but it was nothing major ... the various lens filters ( 3 filter set and uv filter ) and the macro and telephoto lenses included were sized for a 58mm , while the 18-140mm lens in the nikon kit is a 67mm lens , so these items are not usable with this nikon kit . but they replaced the fiters and refunded for the macro and telephoto lenses ( $ 20 ) .
__label__negative__ very small and cheaply made .
__label__positive__ love it .
__label__negative__ this is not the most uncomfortable strap i 've ever put on , but it 's close . the design of the strap and the padded foam cause this thing to dig in to the back of my shoulder . even with a hooded sweatshirt on i ca n't comfortably wear this strap . the construction of the strap is solid and i would feel bad if i did n't mention that . the solid construction got it to 2 stars , but the fact that i 'll never use this strap keeps it at 2 stars . btw , my camera is a fuji xt1 , not some huge dslr monster
__label__positive__ works as stated .
__label__positive__ great ! it fits well , reverses well and works well . what more is there to say ?
__label__positive__ great camera . easily takes awesome shots and videos . my 6 year old grandson has a great time using it in their pool . was perfect for beach trips with the grandkids . very durable but that means it is a little heavier than most point and shoot cameras . most of the & # 34 ; floating wrist straps & # 34 ; do not keep it from sinking .
__label__positive__ i like it . i am excited to use it when my is at college and i can see him and talk with him .
__label__negative__ a total waste of $ money $ for anyone who cares to not get ripped off . they are playing with your imagination by marketing this product as worth the savings . flat out lies . cant say you were n't warned here first . good luck
__label__positive__ nice package for the price .
__label__positive__ spare batteries or replacing spent batteries are always handy .
__label__positive__ this the third selfie stick i bought and the first one that worked with my iphone 6 .
__label__negative__ this was cheaply made and tightening each leg as i lengthened it was a night mare . did n't stay tight . the legs became loose and one of them broke . this was all within a month of getting it with minimal use .
__label__positive__ great bag for video gadgets . well made and good cushion .
__label__positive__ i love this camera ! it takes great close up and zoom shots , it works well , and it 's easy to use . i ca n't say enough about it !
__label__negative__ the selfie stick is not describe that perfect as the customers review ! i ` m very upset for this selfie stick because it is not working well for my iphone 6 . the zoom in and zoom out is totally not working and take forever to connect my bluetooth ! < br / > definitely , i want to return it and wo n't buy it anymore ! ! !
__label__positive__ just as described . received very timely .
__label__positive__ works really good easy to set up as well.cameras are not the best and 2 of the 4 got wet when it rained other 2 still work good . company did replace them free of charge . other than that for price u realy ca n't go wrong .
__label__positive__ i did a lot of research over several months , trying to find a more & # 34 ; upper grade & # 34 ; camcorder on a smaller budget . finally bit the bullet , and ordered this one . i love it . i love all of the things it can do , and eventually , i will become good at using it ! i purchased it so that i can make nature videos , with my own music ( i am a composer ) . it is perfect for my needs . i have experimented with the dual recording , recording mp4s on one card and the higher quality video on the other card . because i ca n't see a lot of difference , and am not that picky , i mostly now use the mp4 recording . with two 64 gb cards , i can pretty much film all day if i keep my spare battery handy and charged ! by the way , there is a software you can put on your computer to easily transfer your files . sometimes i use it , sometimes i just use the camcorder as a usb drive and bring them over myself . so far i have had no luck whatsoever in setting up wifi to transfer them that way , but i do n't mind . probably quicker the way i do it . i do n't send them to any social media , or to my phone , or a tablet or anything , just to my desktop so i can view them all , save and catalogue the ones i want for the future , and use them with my video production software and my music . this is a great tool for my work and i highly recommend it .
__label__positive__ good not great
__label__positive__ great camera but only 9-7p foscam technical support . you can not speak with a u.s. technician < br / > i 'd really like to give it 5 stars but i 've had some issues from the beginning . i 've had the foscam f19826p for two weeks now . first let me say that the initial start up as a 'plug and play ' device was easy and right out of box the camera looks pro grade construction . when i followed the directions of using my iphone to scan the qr code on the bottom of the camera i had live images right away . the resolution between high def and ir night is fantastic ! < br / > i had a problem with the foscam cloud ( separate app you will need to download ) initially after i followed the directions for port forwarding . you need to be moderately tech savvy to properly access your own router and set up port forwarding . between my own internet provider and foscam it took a call and waited 30 minutes for foscam tech support which is only in india . even though the support and site says 'foscam u.s. ' you will only be able to speak with someone overseas , there is some language difficulties with their accents . the over seas only technician also wants to access your computer with their remote foscam team viewer app , so you will need to be comfortable and trusting with them getting inside your computer as well . once my first issue was resolved i had great results and the motion detection notifications were pretty quick , unfortunately after a week the camera stopped responding to my wi fi connection and i had to unplug , pull down , move and manually connect the camera via ethernet cable close to my router . i then had to re fresh my settings with it manually plugged in via ethernet cable to get the camera back online so i could move it again to it 's original location . the real benefit is to place it anywhere so you can go wireless with it. < br / > out of the three non u.s. tech support guys i spoke with , they were very difficult to understand at times . i live in florida so i think the latest trouble i had was not foscam 's issue as much as it could have been a power surge with storms . so , i 'm adding a surge protector and battery back up for the camera. < br / > there are two foscam apps you will need on your phone or tablet , the foscam one and foscam cloud . the other issue that seems to be consistent is the foscam 'cloud app ' wont always display the live video image on my phone , the capture mode should be set to 'both ' but quite often i 'm only getting the snap shots on my iphone for motion detection . regardless , though the foscam cloud stores the images so i was able to log on from primary or another desktop computer and see the live images recorded and stored . the other thing to make sure after you start streaming to your phone or tablet is to make sure your comfortable with the 720p high def images downloading on your mobile plan because it will suck up all your data and your carrier then may charge you extra ca $ h ! so my wife and i only check in whenever possible over a wi-fi connection. < br / > < br / > one of the coolest features is panning/rotating the camera up to 300 deg and a tilt of 100deg , the zoom features are of very good quality too . it 's instantaneous over a wi-fi connection but there was a lag of about 5-10 seconds for panning the camera over a 4g connection when we were out of town for the evening. < br / > < br / > in summary i would buy the camera again and might get a second one . my solid complaint though is there should be 24/7 tech support , they are only available over seas and you will only get someone from 9-7p .
__label__positive__ very good instant polaroid pictures ! having my pictures right away is great ! works good and the pictures look awesome . no need to wait to get them develop . no need to go no where i can have them instantly in my hands to share with my family and friends .
__label__positive__ wooks great
__label__positive__ good for linear systems . this remote will not work with genie garage door openers .
__label__positive__ great replacement for the original gopro batteries which cost a crap ton more . these even hold a longer charge it seems .
__label__positive__ camera is great but software that comes with it does not work . took me several hours to get it to work
__label__negative__ did not fit my coolpix camera . did not seal properly .
__label__negative__ i was looking forward to gettig this lens for my nikon d5200 . it does not work . it is a little tight to attach and when attached the camera says & # 34 ; no lens attached & # 34 ; . i had the camera on manual focus but that did n't help . the sticker on the box said nikon and the lens cap said & # 34 ; for nikon & # 34 ; on the inside . i am returning this to amazon tomorrow . i see in the reviews that at least one other person had the same problem .
__label__positive__ adorable
__label__negative__ this thing is crap . the only time it picks up movement is if you are no more than 2 feet away . this my 2nd one after the manufacturer told me the problem would be resolved . this one is going back also .
__label__negative__ dropped it once and all the springs came out and went away . camera caps should be able to be dropped occassionally . this one is cheap and not worth buying . spend the money and buy a real one
__label__neutral__ made a huge difference in the quality of film . i work on documentaries so there is a lot of walking and car shots . it was fairly smooth , but i see where there was room for improvement . the biggest problem however is the squeaky noise that the stabilizer makes . also it was very easy for people to knock into the camera and i almost lost my camera because someone ran into it throwing it off balance . it is a good start but i think i am going to get the slightly more expensive glide cam. < br / > < br / > this would be great as a stabilizer for an iphone 6 . just get the adapter and you 're set . it is just ok as an intro for the dslr enthusiast .
__label__neutral__ tripod is flimsy but what do you expect . one of the hdmi cords just does n't work at all . keeps flickering , but when i swapped it out with another one it worked perfectly .
__label__negative__ did not fit my lens as indicated .
__label__positive__ very good product
__label__negative__ do n't waste your money on this . it lasted less than 24 hours before turning the color of the expo marker , then it proceeded to break in every place imaginable within a five day shoot . needless to say this was thrown out as soon as the shoot was over . we had to hold it together with gaff tape and superglue to make it last the full five days .
__label__positive__ good camera , for the price it works great
__label__positive__ does what it 's supposed to do .
__label__positive__ this camera integrated very easily into my adt pulse system with minimum hassle and it worked very well . it provides a very good wide angle view with quality resolution for a camera in this price range . it came with power cord extender and works very well as a wireless camera . i have operated it through the adt pulse application and it integrates and works just as well as the indoor camera installed by adt when i upgraded to my adt pulse system .
__label__negative__ it has a terrible viewing field which is very hard to see or focus . i would return it if i could figure out how .
__label__positive__ amazing array of fun accessories . the case even has space for the gopro camera as well as all the stuff that comes in the kit .
__label__negative__ i bought 8 cameras swann swpro-535cam , these cameras are working properly , except that the resolution is very bad and not appreciate sharp images. < br / > < br / > in short , i do not recommend this camera or brand swann .
__label__positive__ i 'm a photographer and i love these . great
__label__positive__ no problems yet with this tripod , great price , smooth filming , i use it for my sports/nature shots , could n't go back to a non-tripod life .
__label__positive__ nice . back to the 60 's
__label__positive__ does a good job during the day and night
__label__positive__ super easy to install. < br / > the material looks real from a distance but once close and when you have it on your hands , it 's a very cheap plastic material .
__label__positive__ i am very happy with my reflectors . it really is a convenient size to carry along on small photo shoots with the rest of my gear . good quality , solid and well thought out when made . i see this becoming a mainstay in my gear since it has all of the main styles i use in one simple location versus carrying my larger individual ones around . for the price i am very pleased .
__label__positive__ this works well , turns off when done , and the price is right
__label__positive__ excellent portable tripod . i always toss one into both cars . a little light for my full size nikon but a1 for my canon g15
__label__negative__ this is the worst system ever not worth the money . after 40 days the 4 of the 8 cameras have condensation on the interior lens . i would not use these in any outdoor environment . i live in a relatively dry warm climate so these would horrible damper climates . the zsight app is good although a bit jumpy with live streaming . i would stay away from this product .
__label__positive__ this is everything as advertised : light weight and compact , easy to set up , stable ... i bought the mefoto smartphone adapter and it will be perfect for taking videos and photos !
__label__negative__ using two batteries , this gives me way worse battery life than not using it at all . it drains the battery even when everything is turned off . it functions as a battery grip but most of the buttons and the lcd screen are utterly pointless . it displays the time and date . that 's all .
__label__positive__ overall these are pretty good . they are the cheaper ones i could find . the one flaw that i see they have is on half the sides they look faded and not as smooth as the other sides . meaning the letters and numbers are faded . i can touch them up in photoshop but not everyone can . so keep this in mind when purchasing if it could be a problem . it probably would be worth a couple dollars more to get a nicer pair .
__label__positive__ very large , exactly what i wanted
__label__positive__ i purchased this charger and an extra battery for my camera to make certain i always had a fully charged battery at the ready . i have only used the charger twice , but so far , it has performed exactly as advertised .
__label__positive__ very easy to use . great pic . good gift .
__label__negative__ item purchased on this link from 'best-deals ' is not actually origem product . item is not as pictured . does not include origem bag and the camera will not slide into the plastic case due to a tab on the back that would cover the battery access area ( which would prevent you from every taking off the battery cover , much less remove the battery to recharge or change ) . i ordered 2 of these because i have two xiaomi yi cameras i purchased to film a zero-budget documentary . now i have to send them crap back and order different ones . thanks for wasting valuable production time , & # 34 ; best-deals & # 34 ; .
__label__neutral__ this kit is relatively sturdy for its economical price . it is easy , if not quick , to assemble and disassemble . however , do not leave studiopro-branded bulbs lit and unattended . see my review of the [ [ asin : b00mezf6pi studiopro professional quality 105 watt cfl photo fluorescent spiral daylight light bulbs 5500k color temperature ( 4 pack ) ] ] replacement bulbs , bought to replace the fairly weak ones in this kit . one of those bulbs burst into flames on first use , and another 's base was faulty on second use .
__label__positive__ great little camera . comes in handy when hooking up my boat trailer too .
__label__positive__ great value . ca n't beat the quality of the optics for the price .
__label__positive__ the canon eos 500d , also known as the canon eos rebel t1i , is a 15.1mp slr camera. < br / > < br / > offering 15-megapixel resolution , excellent low-light performance , and high-definition video recording , the canon eos 500d is a camera that 's good enough for many professional shooting situations . packed into a small , lightweight body , and shipping in a kit with a 18mm to 55mm lens , the canon eos 500d costs around £600 . canon also sells a body-only configuration. < br / > < br / > for the most part , the canon eos 500d is a very compact camera that does n't sacrifice comfort or stable shooting to achieve its small footprint . the overall control layout is largely unchanged from previous models , so if you 're already familiar with the canon eos 500d 's ancestors , you 'll feel right at home with the new camera. < br / > < br / > as with all canon slrs , almost all of the essential shooting controls are accessible through external camera controls . white balance , autofocus , drive mode , exposure compensation , exposure lock , and program shift modes all have dedicated buttons , and the canon eos 500d 's control layout allows you to easily alter any of these parameters ( as well as shutter speed , aperture , and iso ) with one hand. < br / > < br / > since essential exposure controls are right near the shutter button , you can easily change shutter speed , aperture , and iso without ever removing your eye from the viewfinder. < br / > < br / > digital photography reviews and advice < br / > < br / > in addition to size , the main feel and interface difference between the canon eos 500d and canon 's mid-range cameras ( like the canon eos 50d ) is the control layout on the back of the camera . where the 50d provides a rear-mounted wheel that you use for navigating menus and changing parameter settings , the canon eos 500d offers four buttons arranged in a circle . while the wheel is a little faster , and is easier to use without looking , the rebel 's four-way button pad works fine , and you should find navigation and control quick and easy. < br / > < br / > the 3in lcd on the canon eos 500d is canon 's latest , and it 's beautiful . it has more resolution ( 920,000 dots ) and better detail than the screen on any previous rebel , and provides easier-to-read menus and a clear , sharp view of your images , even in bright sunlight. < br / > < br / > as with any lcd screen , it 's still not accurate for judging colour and exposure , though the on-screen histogram gives you a way to work around those limitations . and while the canon eos 500d 's screen does show very fine detail , it 's still not good enough for assessing subtle focus problems. < br / > < br / > as with previous models , the canon eos 500d 's lcd screen automatically deactivates when you raise the camera to your eye , so you do n't have it shining in your face while shooting. < br / > < br / > the lcd screen displays all of the canon eos 500d 's current status information , and you can even change settings using this screen . the ability to see and alter settings on the back of the camera is great when you 're working on a tripod. < br / > < br / > the canon eos 500d , also known as the canon eos rebel t1i , is a 15.1mp slr camera. < br / > < br / > the canon eos 500d offers live view , but canon has streamlined the live view interface . there 's now a dedicated live view button on the back of the camera , and you no longer have to go into a menu to activate the live view feature. < br / > < br / > if you 've never used live view on an slr , be aware that autofocusing is different than what you may be used to on a point-and-shoot camera . when you activate live view , the camera has to raise the mirror ( the one that normally bounces light from the lens up into the viewfinder ) to expose the sensor , to generate a live image to show on the lcd screen. < br / > < br / > unfortunately , the autofocus sensors are in the top of the camera , so when the mirror goes up , the autofocus sensors go blind . this means that , unlike with a point-and-shoot camera , the canon eos 500d can not continuously autofocus when in live view mode. < br / > < br / > bydefault when in live view mode , the canon eos 500d autofocuses by using its internal computer to analyze the image , rather than using the usual autofocus sensors .
__label__positive__ nice case
__label__neutral__ the lens does not come with front camera and it did not say in the specifications
__label__negative__ i 'm disappointed with this charger . for some reason , it 's not charging my battery to the fullest , although the green light , which comes on when it 's supposed to be charges , indicates that it 's charged . i used the camera to charge the battery and that seems to be fine ; not happy with this product .
__label__positive__ i have 3 words : dbpower , dbpower , dbpower . it 's hands down a solid camera i recommend to anyone . if you 're on a budget this is for you . picture quality was excellent and you can take quality pictures on it also . i love the screen on the back it makes it easy to set up shots and change settings quickly . lastly , it came with an abundance of accessories like bike mounts , or an extra battery . there 's so many i do n't even use all of them , but when the time comes , you 'll have what you need. < br / > < br / > i recently went overseas and used the camera underwater in with the waterproof case and it 's legit . no leaks . honestly , the dbpower is better than the gopro which is overrated in my opinion. < br / > < br / > i bought this camera and a selfie stick for about $ 75. < br / > < br / > rating : a++
__label__positive__ very happy with purchase . great quality product for a great price . love the style and color or the aluminum screws . fast delivery . would recommend this seller and definitely would use this seller again .
__label__positive__ awesome camera , this kit comes with the essentials that are needed .
__label__positive__ perfect for my needs~
__label__positive__ great product ! easy to transport , set up , and use . i love the lighting i achieve with it indoors and out . i definitely recommend either having an assistant to hold it if you are outdoors or bring sandbags as a 60 & # 34 ; umbrella will blow over in the slightest wind .
__label__positive__ i bought one recently second hand , but like new . it only cost $ 25.00 inc shipping . worth the money..it was for a nikon . only thing i found was not very good at low light and the auto focus seemed a bit sluggish sometimes . but for the price , it 's a great walkabout lens .
__label__neutral__ the album is exactly what i was looking for but the rings do n't line up properly .
__label__positive__ fun and stylish
__label__positive__ great product ! i 've used this floaty handle a bunch while swimming and kayaking . i really feel better about not losing my go pro .
__label__positive__ this is a great little battery holder and works better than keeping the batteries in the snap on plastic they came in . the only reason i did n't give it a 5 star is because the fit is very tight . i am contacting the company to suggest they just give us another fraction of an inch for a more comfortable sliding in and out . otherwise , love it .
__label__positive__ great value ! much better than most tripods in this price range .
__label__positive__ works great ! i use to get dizzy when watching my video but now i do n't have that issue using the gimbal . a must have .
__label__positive__ perform as claim , this is my 2nd purchase
__label__negative__ very cool design . build quality is solid . however the image quality is very poor . i bought it because i figured it was 720p like the rest of my ubiquiti cameras , but it is no where near the same . ended up selling it on ebay for $ 160 ; )
__label__positive__ great half-case for the x100s . love the material , the light weight construction , battery access , and how it 's made in usa . i 'd gladly support the company by buying from them in the near future .
__label__positive__ nice 'nocs . nothing spectacular but they are great for the price . i have had no complaints with these .
__label__negative__ terrible camera that does n't hold charge . we put fresh batteries in this camera for our daughters 1st disney world trip and it still would n't work . i was highly disappointed in it . i love the fact that it is small and easy to use but it does n't work . we only used it on one vacation and now it no longer even works .
__label__positive__ item came quickly and as described . bought this 5 weeks ago . straps are holding up well .
__label__negative__ my last sony after years of buying sony . the products has all sorts of annoying traits , meaning they have lost their minds . no way to attached the lens cap so it is always lost . the flash is situated back on the camera so that if you take a close up it shadows . the color is fine and focused , but gads these constant reminders that pop up every time you change the camera mod , and i ca n't seem to turn off except by pushing the button ! it made me resort to read the manual and still it is elusive ! the controls are not very clear so that you set it for stills of filming and it reverts . okay , sony had a good run in our business but that time is over. < br / > update < br / > after having sony 's that lasted 3-6 years , this one lasted 16 months . it was a poorly designed camera and i am so sorry that sony is now a camera company that i wont go back to -- especially as they know they have the exact issue with the camera that went wrong and do not offer any resolution , and the cost of repairing is more than the camera .
__label__positive__ a great lens that i use on my nikon d750 . if you like a heavy , large lens this is the one for you . photos are outstanding . most pleased , by clearly if you want something light and small you may want to look elsewhere .
__label__positive__ i love the look of this case , goes well with the retro feel of the camera . though the material looks a bit cheaper then i it appears in the photo . it has a bit more wear and tear then i was expecting after only three months , but i 'm always throwing it in a backpack and on the run . i feel it keeps the camera safe overall . the gap between the base cover and top cover is larger then i anticipated . also would be nice if i could change the battery without taking the base off , you have to unscrew the base from the place you can attach to a tripod . on the plus side you can attach it to a tripod with the base on. < br / > < br / > overall , and for the price i am pleased , though long term i plan to upgrade to something a little nicer .
__label__positive__ perfect ... . got exactly what i was expecting 🙌
__label__positive__ works as advertised . charged up my batteries for my range finder .
__label__negative__ had to return it three times because the first time the screw was stripped , then the mechanics were messed up , and now we need to use chord to hold the screws in ! love the product , but for $ 300 , it seems a little ridiculous they ca n't quality check their products .
__label__positive__ this case works great . it has pockets and compartments useful for all my gear . it even came with a cleaning cloth .
__label__negative__ poor quality
__label__positive__ purchased this camera for my 2 week trip through europe . though i have a nikon 5100 and love it , i opted to travel with a smaller camera for convenience without sacraficing too much . i purchased an additional battery and a samsung 64gb sd card along with a nikon ac charger . the s9900 performed as expected through my 2400+ shots . the zoom was good , though it is not as crisp at full optical zoom as it is with a high quality glass lens on dslr . the shots are generally very crisp . the hdr feature is not as good or intuitive . the flash does an okay job , but the charge time between flashes were surprisingly quick - almost instantaneous . i liked the manual release feature of the flash as i do n't have to worry of accidental activation of the flash when in environments where flash is prohibited . based on usage throughout my trip , i burned through two batteries daily . the included charger was disappointing . it takes about 3 hours to fully charge . considering i had to charge two batteries nightly , i was glad i purchased an additional charger ( just as slow ) with the extra battery. < br / > < br / > i have been generally satisified with the s9900 . i just have to remember that it is n't a dslr , so i need to set my expectation accordingly .
__label__positive__ i really like it . i use it alot and its pretty big . bigger than i thought actually , which is still good
__label__positive__ love this item . . i use it on my salon
__label__positive__ perfect for me who has 2 gopro hero 4s and a lot of accessories.. not everything fits but this helps a lot
__label__positive__ after about a month i 'm very happy with the nest cam as a way to keep tabs on my mischievous scottish terrier during the day while i 'm at work . i love being able to yell at him when he 's barking at birds / neighbors / his shadow / etc . also , the image quality is fantastic and the nest aware recording system is dead simple to use. < br / > < br / > the one issue i 've had is with the app notifications on my phone . in the old dropcam app , there was a way to automatically disable motion & sound notifications when i was home , which was great because the camera kept recording but my phone was n't dinging every time i went to the fridge . the current app lacks this , however . the options are to turn the camera off altogether or turn off notifications . because i 'm paying for nest aware , i do n't want the camera turned off , but i do want app notifications when i 'm not home , so turning them off is n't an option either. < br / > < br / > adding back in the option to automatically disable just the notifications when i 'm home would make this 5 stars .
__label__positive__ plugged right in and worked right out of the box ... ..
__label__positive__ not much to talk about , it is ridiculously easy to install and sounds pretty good .
__label__positive__ it works really well and is expandable to many dimensions . very happy with my backdrop holder .
__label__positive__ great . easy to use and set up and really easy to take out camping away from the city lights !
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ great product . not too heavy . perfect for bringing on hikes .
__label__positive__ looks real enough , but the batteries on the larger cameras wear out quickly !
__label__positive__ if you are an active shooter , and do n't have a sling strap , you are making a terrible , terrible mistake . hang your head in shame .
__label__positive__ filters slide in easily and stay put . keeps them clean and easy to access .
__label__positive__ just as described - arrived on time and works perfectly .
__label__positive__ i go snorkeling a lot and this float strap works great .
__label__negative__ low quality printing . i 'd go with another company/ design .
__label__positive__ really nice camera case , plus you can leave it on /attached and still take pictures .
__label__positive__ nice product . will order one more right now . great for dslr attachement and slider set up . 5stars < br / > please check out our youtube channel passionfordrive
__label__positive__ i bought this to go with my range scope since it has a canted eye piece . i can adjust this mount to hold the scope sideways and do n't have to strain my neck to see perfectly . it 's very stable on the ground . love it .
__label__positive__ the best light weight carbon fiber tripod that i could afford , at the moment. < br / > the ballhead provided would be adequate for most cameras , but i plan on using this with the < br / > vanguard sbh-300 ballhead , and the mamiya rb67 . might not be a very stable combination , < br / > but my wife has restrictions on the amount of equipment i can take on our cruise to alaska .
__label__positive__ case came super fast and is just perfect for my camera ca n't wait to take it out and use it
__label__negative__ i never buy cheap stuff anymore , just loosing your money . unsharp and not for 1080p and surely not 4k .
__label__negative__ this is an amazing aircraft and i love it. < br / > < br / > there are significant problems with camera gimbal stability . i returned the first one because of this and now the replacement has the same trouble. < br / > < br / > the support phone number on dji 's website isnt working right now , hopefully it is a temporary problem .
__label__positive__ worked perfectly , no problems. < br / > very good buy .
__label__positive__ this is one of my favorite purchases i 've made in a while . the quality is great and fits my 30 pound dog perfectly . get ready for some of the most hilarious gopro video you will ever shoot .
__label__positive__ nice system for the cost .
__label__positive__ the pictures turn out great ! i love this camera for pictures . i also bought it to take short video clips . i use a professional lighting system in my living room and the video comes out a bit grainy . i wish i had gone for a camera that records in 60 fps . but , the great pictures it takes is worth it !
__label__positive__ everything was as promised . thanks !
__label__neutral__ the camera is great ... .comes with no manual ! the case they sent does not hold the camera ... ..just the accessories .
__label__positive__ does everything it said it would .
__label__positive__ it seem good for the price , i will use it and update the review .
__label__positive__ camera is perfect for me and it has helped me with my golf swing . j-made ensured that i got it quickly and i appreciated their excellent customer service in doing so .
__label__negative__ the reflector is too small to be practical , yet it does n't fold small enough to stuff it in my handbag . because it does n't have a stand and most times there 's no place to prop it up , it is difficult to hold it with one hand while shooting pictures or video with the other . you could use a clamp for this , but i do n't want to carry more things .
__label__positive__ had read reviews saying quality was alright , glad i did n't pay attention . for the price , great case .
__label__positive__ it 's built solid with metal . quite short , and not as long as the first reviewer makes it seem . picture quality with a 32mm plossl was quite good , deteriorated with higher powers ( not the len 's fault ) . good buy , but i would n't recommend using this with any eyepiece less than 9mm .
__label__positive__ great for mid size camera and enough storage < br / > great protection < br / > just what i needed
__label__positive__ we purchased this as a back up for our camera and choose the canon as that is what our camera called for also we read some reviews for the knock offs which may not serve as well .
__label__positive__ my little darling wanted a gopro in the worst way , so for his birthday , we got everything for him . everything . and he loved it . he loved it so much , he took it everywhere with him . and put the mounts all over the house and the yard and on his bike ... . and then needed more mounts before he went on his vacation to the beach . now , the official gopro mounts are very expensive and i wanted to find a more realistically priced set of mounts for him . when i found these , i decided it could n't hurt to try them . and he loves them ! he actually told me that they stick better than the official ones ! he 's stuck one on his surfboard and another on the golf cart and he 's still trying to devise two more places to put the other ones . they 've held really well and the plastic is super sturdy . he 's very happy with these and that makes me happy ! < br / > < br / > i received these mounts for free in exchange for a genuine critique .
__label__positive__ my work demands light weight systems and so use a micro four thirds camera and this lens posed obvious challenges . after what seemed eternity the lens arrived payed for by putting it on my children 's student loans - they will never notice as they are doing law and medicine . it took a while loading everything up helped by the ease of finding space for my small lightweight mft camera , after a few days we worked our way around the intimidating face of the front element and then out of the permanent shadow of its green bulk , to the rear and set up our main base camp . an early predawn start allowed clearing the difficult main overhang by midday so by mid afternoon we reached the top of the rear element and grateful i invested in such a lightweight mft camera . i do n't think i would have made it with a full frame system and carrying oxygen was beyond our capability . the view from the top of the sigma was quite spectacular and i wish i had a more powerfull zoom with me other than my ever faithful panny 100-300. < br / > the sigma will always be there though and i will be back for another ascent next year .
__label__positive__ best camera i ever have had .
__label__positive__ just a battery , lol .
__label__positive__ perfect
__label__positive__ well made
__label__neutral__ this is nice , but it 's not the extension i thought it would be . still useful , but it really needs either a double male ball and/or another slider to be really useful . trying to provide a long arm extension with an additional mounting point to steady it .
__label__positive__ i ca n't say whether the battery life is as long as the factory gopro batteries , as i have n't done a side by side test . but i 've used these batteries in the camera and so far so good .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ no issues , so far so good
__label__positive__ this kit is awesome ! i ca n't believe how well everything works . everything fits into the pouch and it slips onto the strap of my camera bag .
__label__positive__ excellent flash to use .
__label__neutral__ i had it for a few days before realizing that i was settling for mediocracy . ( is that a word ? ) to be honest , the cameras on y'all smart phones will take better pictures and better quality videos than this little thing , and when i say little , it 's about the size of a bar of soap . it 's very basic . it does n't do anything well , just good enuff . it said hd but at times it looks like a flip fone 's vga camera . so i took it back .
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ good and cute ！
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ solid overall build quality , the movable hook-and-loop dividers are definitely handy for keeping things contained/snug the way you want , and a good amount of room for most of the accessories you could potentially want for basic dslr needs . mine is currently holding the camera with a lens attached , a spare lens , a couple spare batteries , a couple battery chargers ( home & car ) , a few lens filters , various manuals , and still has room for another item or two . the tripod straps on the side also work pretty well for their intended purpose , although a heavier tripod can make the balance weird and make the backpack hang a little funny on your back < br / > < br / > **however** , the dye used in the fabric is like the dye used in some clothing - it is not necessarily color-fast ! i took it with me hiking on vacation , and i got hot and sweaty enough that they black dye bled into the back of the shirt i was wearing . considering it was a light-blue shirt , i was a little disgruntled to discover this . and naturally , the dye has n't come out after washing the shirt. < br / > < br / > so overall it 's a decent backpack - just do n't take it with you on hot , sweaty occasions ( or wear an old shirt that you do n't care about ) .
__label__neutral__ does not charge other gopro batteries .
__label__positive__ i bought this for a lightweight ( cheap ) spotting scope . i found it sufficient for that purpose . the build quality is fair considering the ~ $ 10 price . it has a little knob at the top to enable and disable a ball pivot independent of the bendy legs which is nice for fixing cant and adjusting elevation . further , the bendy legs themselves have a fair amount of flex in them while being very sturdy and difficult to bend without some real effort . i would caution against purchasing for anything that weighs more than ~5 pounds , so small digital cameras and optics would be fine .
__label__positive__ received this yesterday and works perfectly .
__label__negative__ update : i hate this piece of crap . so the first one barely worked , was n't even the right camera , was used , terribly wuality , 720p , not 1080p etc ( see below ) . the second camera was also crap but slightly better ... now , a couple days into using it , it stops working . completely dead . comes on every once in a while but then freezes up and shuts down ( yes , battery fully charged ) . total garbage , not even work $ 5 . do not buy ! < br / > < br / > - the price was ok when it was $ 33/camera but they raised it to $ 48 . not a good deal anymore as you can get some much better cameras for that price. < br / > < br / > - one of the two cameras i received does n't even really work . just records mostly black . can barely see anything . i tried adjusting the exposure value but nothing changes . went through all options but ... still records mostly black . this is the camera that i know was used before because it has scratches and marks on it . so really i can only ( barely ) use 1. < br / > < br / > - in fact , i just found it it 's not even the same type of camera ! ! ! it looks similar but one has a much wider field of view than the other , which has a view like a telescope ! < br / > < br / > - it is not 1080p , it is 720 at around 15fps . definitely not event close to 30 or even 24fps . the footage is sort of usable if you are using it as a dashboard camera ( as i am ) . < br / > < br / > - it is not wide angle . the angle is very narrow so even using it as dashboard camera , you wo n't get very much unless you are aiming it directly at what you want to see . i mean , my galaxy s5 has probably twice the & # 34 ; wide angle & # 34 ; this thing has ... and my galaxy s5 does n't even technically have a wide angle ! < br / > < br / > - i would put one extra star just for the price except that these cameras ( i got 2 ) are not new as advertised . they are definitely used . they both came with different parts ( some missing parts ) , different chargers ( one has a cheap ripoff iphone charger ) and one came with little pieces of plastic covering the glass and stuff ( you know , that stuff you peal off ) and the other came with only some of that plastic on and it was a different type of plastic ( like some generic , oversized plastic pieces ) . someone messed with the settings on one of the cameras so it was a lot different from the other one. < br / > < br / > - it 's absolutely unusable at night . even during the day , shadows are basically pitch black . you can raise the exposure but it does n't really do anything. < br / > < br / > do n't false advertise , seller ! that plastic on and it was a different type of plastic ( like some generic , oversized plastic pieces ) . someone messed with the settings on one of the cameras so it was a lot different from the other one . - it 's absolutely unusable at night . even during the day , shadows are basically pitch black . you can raise the exposure but it does n't really do anything . do n't false advertise , seller !
__label__positive__ excellent ! ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ the mounting for the cameras is not the best and it doesnt prevent the cameras from moving but everything else works fine
__label__positive__ just what i wanted
__label__positive__ awesome
__label__positive__ amazing product . looks like the original one that i lost and does not feel flimsy in any way . very sturdy and a very tight fit . it does not fall off . the price was also good for 3 of these . i bought this product for my nikon d5100. < br / > < br / > overall : < br / > quality : 10/10 < br / > recommend : yes
__label__positive__ we have had no problems with this camcorder since we bought it . ca n't go wrong with sony .
__label__positive__ wish they were better in the dark and had a ir mode , but they are amazing for how cheap they are ! video quality is great in well lit areas ! just have to lower them on the bridge of your nose if your any kind of tall ...
__label__positive__ works much better than other products on the market . i 'm satisfied .
__label__positive__ these are probably a little pricey , but i had one fail , and they have worked well and i knew what i was getting . the one that failed was for a camera in a tree . the cable with balun has been hanging in a tree unshielded from the elements for a few years b4 it failed . it was pretty badly rusted and corroded . it worked well considering . is probably about 125 to 150 feet length of cable . works as well as the cameras with the oem cables .
__label__negative__ you do not want to buy these cameras . there are two primary reasons . first , they do not work on modern wifi frequencies . second , and this is far more important , they drop the wifi signal if a pigeon farts . and , when they do , they do not reacquire unless you manually unpower and repower . hence , they are useless for an unattended monitoring purpose . if you have a vacation home and the internet powers off then comes back on you must send a human in to physically reset the camera in order for it to reacquire its wifi link . what'smore , the manufacture freely admits this and acknowledges it is a firmware problem which they are & # 34 ; aware of and working on. & # 34 ; meanwhile , you are stuck with a beautiful to look at but not particularly useful piece of tech . i really hated writing this review because these cameras are simply elegant to set up and lovely in the room . sadly , they fail in operation . independently tested and verified on four units . sorry .
__label__negative__ arrived broken in several places . super cheaply made ! would not buy again !
__label__neutral__ first i would like to say the camera works great and takes good pictures , not as fast as i would like but no problem . now lets talk about service from samsung , on the camera there is a cover that covers the pop up flash , while using camera that part must of fallen off and i did not notice because flash worked fine . camera was not dropped or misused . so i contact support thru the web which was challenge because form would not work right . but by not logging into my account i got it to accept info . uploaded picture as they asked and sales receipt . i get a email saying to call about what i needed , i explained what happen and that i would pay for part if they would send it to me . i was informed that since it was physical damage he was voiding my warranty . explained no physical damage the part fell off on its own . to me a flaw in camera , but again i said i would pay for part . was told i had to send camera in , i was not allowed to do myself and it would take at least a month . gave me a number for a claim for repair and a told to number to call if i got disconnected . the repair center was not open , should n't samsung of knowed this ! but to void my warranty without seeing camera and telling me to call a place that was not open was last straw . i buy samsung products because of quality and they used to stand behind there products , not anymore .
__label__positive__ great value , quick shipping . i 'd buy again !
__label__neutral__ the head strap is on point , but the chest strap does n't face forward . in order to see straight ahead you need to order another piece .
__label__positive__ i love it !
__label__neutral__ not really loud enough . sensitive and does what it is required .
__label__positive__ using a mac and chrome i did not have any problems setting up the motion zones as mentioned in older posts . this must have been fixed in the latest firmware updates . it 's night vision is quite good with my little porch light . it has extensive customisable settings . after updating to the latest firmware 1.02.03 as of july 2015 here are my issues . *must reboot the camera frequently if making setup changes *could not get motion detection to write to sd card . i finally figured out if i set it up to record a few files on continuous recording mode and then flipping on the motion detection recording method it started to write files . *at night the motion detection doesn ’ t work correctly . it pretty much detects motion constantly . i tried changing all the settings even turning the sensitivity to 0 % and turning off the passive ir sensor and it was still constantly detecting motion . *anti-flicker setting makes the image over exposed i want to add how i was able to get the video files to save to a usb drive plugged into my airport extreme base station 4th generation . format disk to fat32 setup in airport utility *guest network enabled *secure shared disk with password mount disk in finder ( from finder go/connect to server/ip of airport extreme ) in dlink camera ip : event setup/server/ *network storage : \\airport extreme ip address\disk name *username : anything *passoword : pw you created for disk in airport utility
__label__neutral__ ok be careful not to over tighten , it will strip the plastic
__label__positive__ works well
__label__positive__ the product was good as advertised . i have several electronic gadgets that need cleaning on a daily basis . the cloths do a great job in clearing away the fingerprints and other grime that appears from time to time .
__label__positive__ this is a neat little tripod . i do n't know how well it would hold a big dslr camera , but it works well with my flip mino video recorder . the short height of this tripod is good for taking group pictures with a timer as long as you have something to set it on besides the ground . the legs are sturdy and do not move on their own , and yet are pretty flexible when you adjust them . you wo n't be bending this sideways or anything , because most cameras weigh more than this thing , but i did n't expect that anyway . the ball feet can sometimes slip if they 're on a curved surface , so if you 're looking for a dashboard tripod it might be more beneficial to find one with suction cups as feet . overall , i 've been happy with this product and have used it only occasionally since 2009 .
__label__positive__ good product ... .
__label__positive__ the lenses and kit are great .
__label__negative__ horrrrrible quality and terrrrible owner manual . plus , it did n't work .
__label__positive__ just what i needed and it got to me so fast i swear i blinked and bam i had it . great battery and price . do not waste your time shopping around , here it is and at the click of a button it is yours and in your hands fast !
__label__negative__ do n't waste your money ! could not get the night mode to work right out of the box . tried everything the faq recommended and even read all the answered questions and still could n't get it to work . i guess you get what you paid for . thank god i can return this piece of crap !
__label__positive__ good product for less money
__label__positive__ cool little camera with a lot of features . have used it underwater , as a good point-and-shoot , and it 's about to travel to tanzania . this is my kayak/motorcycle/snorkel fave .
__label__positive__ great item ! would buy again . did not disappoint .
__label__negative__ let me give you the positive . the person who helped me set it up on the phone was amazing . he did a great job and we were set up and ready to use in under 5 minutes. < br / > < br / > the negative , the image quality is horrible . i did not set it up when it first arrived , i wish i would of right away . when i did hook it up and set it up , after a few days i realized this was a very poor camera . i tried to return it and now i am stuck with it . i would not recommend this for outdoor use . we wanted it for our garage to see who was all pulling in and out of our drive way. < br / > < br / > great support but very poor quality .
__label__positive__ acceptable
__label__positive__ fantastic carbon fiber tripod for way less than the rest . super light and great for traveling though the legs are a little thinner than i expected so it may not be great in windy conditions . i 'm 5'10 & # 34 ; and the camera eyepiece is at eye level with the top column extended . without the top column extended it 's still a comfortable working height to view through the eyepiece or using live view . included bag is nicely padded and protects the tripod in transit . the center column is reversible for shooting super low to the ground ( with the camera upside down ) .
__label__positive__ this had everything i needed for dslr cleaning - works great - would recommend
__label__positive__ i love this meter . is is small and lightweight .
__label__positive__ just what i needed and the remote control works great .
__label__positive__ pelican - what more can one say . used for a gopro . still fitting in accessories . allows custom fit cut outs . the foam is notched so you have some cutting guide lines . use a long slender knife to cut the foam along the perforations .
__label__positive__ good product
__label__positive__ i do n't believe i 've seen microfiber cloths individually wrapped inside resealable bags but , here they are and it 's the first indication of care and quality . these cloths - ordered at a discount as 'for review ' samples - worked great on anything from 27\\ '' monitors down to my phone and glasses . they do well both 'dry ' and when used with some cleaner solution and , once done , they could be sent back into the back or they can be washed so an 8-pack should go a long way. < br / > < br / > the cloths performed well at tasks such as simple dusting , fingerprint lifting and , when used with some cleaner , taking care of some harder to remove accidents . they are great for the price , giving the number of cloths , their quality and their effectiveness .
__label__positive__ having fun with the go pro - only complaint is that it was not clear that an sd card had to be purchased separately . the great deal we thought we go on the go pro was erased by the cost of the card as well as the additional hassle to have to make this purchase to even get it to work .
__label__positive__ i love it ! ! !
__label__positive__ wow , a lot of light for a little money ...
__label__positive__ i bought this lens before a long trip , to replace my 2 kits ( 14-42 and 45-150 ) . i am very glad that i did . it weighs less than the two lenses it replaces , seems to take pictures that are as good as the separate lenses , and of course is much more convenient . changing lenses is always a pain in the field , with risk of dirt , sand , or rain getting on the sensor . this removes the need to change lenses , and i found myself taking pictures in the 45-140 range much more often than i would have had i had to change lenses every time . also the zoom mechanism on this lens is much smoother than the zoom on the 14-42 lens , and you can do smooth video zooming with it .
__label__positive__ great product for a great price . thanks again .
__label__positive__ awesome !
__label__positive__ i was sick & tired of losing my lens cap or having to stuff it in a pocket to take a quick photo . this is a super easy & quick fix . wish i would have found this years ago ! i only needed one , so i can share the other 4 with my family . and the cleaning cloth is a nice little bonus .
__label__positive__ its answer to all my needs .
__label__positive__ the q500+ is an amazing machine . easy to fly right out of the box . no problems with it at all
__label__positive__ this product works just as described . about an inch and a half of the band stuck out of the water while hooked to my nikon aw100 camera . i even left it in the pool where i was testing it for a couple hours and it floated the whole time with us splashing and swimming . i kayak a lot and i have been looking for a product that works like this for a few years and this is the first one i 've found that actually works . i would defiantly recommend this product .
__label__positive__ glad to see i 'm not the only one who could n't fold the thing back up ! ! will be making a trip to youtube for a video ! great size though ! large enough for someone to get in and move around comfortably .
__label__positive__ great case for the money . refill foam is available , which is great if you change your usage . solid hard case .
__label__positive__ perfect fit
__label__positive__ best value for the money . they perform exactly as advertised .
__label__positive__ skeleton frame and clear lens cover fits my hero4 silver perfectly . all ports , lights , and mic line up with holes in the case . it also comes with a threaded tripod mount .
__label__negative__ camera looks good initially . picture quality is decent , both day and night . however , the firmware is buggy , audio wo n't record most of the time , uploading recordings to an ftp server is virtually impossible - and when it does work , you get a 0 byte file . have n't seen a firmware upgrade in months , pleas from multiple users for issue resolution go unanswered . i get it , as with most things you get what you pay for and these cameras are for the budget-minded . however , your product should do what you advertise it can do , and the support should be there also . i 'm going to start looking for another brand of security camera .
__label__positive__ exactly as advertised just what i needed for some tabletop photography .
__label__positive__ love these glasses , thinking about purchasing another pair !
__label__positive__ thanks you really did good job good product ... .thanks
__label__positive__ this is a great security panel i got it a couple months ago and it was easy to install and program if you understand how it works i was able to install it in a day and it 's easy to wire up and add new devices .
__label__negative__ having issues with connectig wire that goes to faux battery..not good only used once
__label__positive__ excellent quality product , but a bit pricey. < br / > < br / > does as advertised ( used it for snorkelling ) .
__label__positive__ fantastic ! my dad is a photog , and i 've used film slrs , but this is much easier to both use and to handle . it 's nice and small , yet feels good in your hand . the technical specs are also just great .
__label__neutral__ not used it so not sure
__label__positive__ i recently bought a set of camkix thumbscrews from amazon.com . i like them allot . they do keep my camera very tight & secure . no doubt i 'll be recommending them to my friends . i belong to a photo club here in salem , oregon and i will be telling my friends at the club about these dandy l'ill gizmos built to keep my camera nice & tight .
__label__positive__ my brother loaned me his for a trip and now i have my own . adjustments for fit and security work perfectly !
__label__positive__ it fits very well to the sigma lens 18-250 . easy to go in and reverse .
__label__positive__ cheapest 5 '' monitor you can buy. < br / > < br / > it might not be neewer when it arrives , mine was n't . i kept it anyway cause it works fine. < br / > < br / > small and light weight . works great on my ronin. < br / > i have a 7 '' monitor but its way too big . 5 '' is perfect for monitoring to make sure your subjects in frame when flying a gimbal/glidecam
__label__positive__ works great , dirt cheap ! hard to top that combo !
__label__positive__ great camera ! everything was included as described . order came on time
__label__positive__ okey
__label__positive__ great camera strap ! beautiful packaging- just got this , but the quality seems really nice- i ca n't wait to start using it !
__label__positive__ solid , works well .
__label__positive__ best solution for glasses wearers , unless you want to drape yourself in a cloth , like ansel adams .
__label__positive__ it 's a little heavy and i have a difficult time using to take clear pictures of my moving kids . but overall it is a great telephoto . the rest of the package is just a bonus .
__label__positive__ excellent camera , superb crisp images and video . multiple functions are easy to use and set up took only minutes , best fpv camera of the year and the price makes it a great value too .
__label__positive__ fantastic
__label__positive__ nice kit wish there was a small thin piece of metal to protect the set screw from bezel damage but i mac gyvered a shim to do the job works great .
__label__positive__ i love it . i just received it , have n't carried it around yet to really judge it , but i love the look , size , and space .
__label__positive__ mom loves it !
__label__positive__ i love it
__label__negative__ if you dont move it ever ... . its great . or if you only need it for a day or two < br / > < br / > if you want to adjust it the goose neck is stronger than the cheapo plastic foot that connects to the camera ... . so yea pos < br / > < br / > worked for 2 weeks .
__label__positive__ worked well . held up to the salt water snorkeling and jumping into the water .
__label__negative__ it worked great and was amazing for a month or so until i did a & # 34 ; forced & # 34 ; firmware update through the iphone app . i spent many hours trying to get it to work consistently again with no success . it was working without recording for a months but the iphone app suggested another firmware update and now it does not work at all . i have more than 10 years experience in it so if someone can configure things it is me . i also worked with cameras in security before so i can tell this was a great product . i wish there was better support that i could send this in . i would like to have it back to where it worked and was the best camera i have seen . i 'm hesitantly considering purchasing a new one because i would like to secure my driveway and already did the wiring for this product . my concern is that it can not consistently perform . i might give it a try through a new one but i feel it is going to be a gamble .
__label__positive__ this is my third breakthrough filter and there have been no disappointments ! the customer service is excellent and how can you beat a 25 year warranty ? the cpl filter arrived in very sturdy packaging that definitely protects the filter during shipping . very high quality . the filter is thin and the build quality is excellent . the rotation is very smooth and the lens coating is uniform across the filter . definitely my go to circular polarizer going forward !
__label__positive__ excellent product !
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid : b9d47c5f5f315608dcddb94b882cef03 ] ]
__label__positive__ amazing amount of gear and really functional as well .
__label__neutral__ i loved the quality and zoom of this camera ! it would be absolutely perfect , except the focus on this camera is horrible . i am a concert junkie , and love to get as many awesome photos as possible . with the focus being so bad , it was really hard to get awesome pictures..i 'm pleased with the photos i got , but it could have been way better .
__label__positive__ fits great ! holds the little gopro easily .
__label__positive__ fit perfectly . great quality !
__label__negative__ i ordered this fi9821p cam but i received an fi8910w ! < br / > i would accept this model if i could update the firmware , but he is to old. < br / > a waist of my time and your money. < br / > sorry .
__label__positive__ solid . ca n't beat the price ! why pay 50 or 60 bucks for a & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; brand name ? this is n't & # 34 ; pro level & # 34 ; equiptment , but it 's perfect for a serious amateur . spend your money on better lenses not overpriced monopods .
__label__positive__ does what it states ... effectively halves the recycle time for my 360 ws pack ... perfect ...
__label__positive__ i really loved these lights . had two of them . eventually the battery cells wore down and the light only lasts a few minutes at most .
__label__positive__ works great .
__label__positive__ i love this camera ! i have a bigger digital camera but this is much easier to use . digital zoom and can work with one hand . bought this for a cruise where we can only use fixed lens .
__label__positive__ awesome purchase ! quality build , and quality price ! < br / > the yellow is very bright , and easy to spot in the water .
__label__positive__ quality case. < br / > < br / > i bought this for the size and price. < br / > < br / > i was afraid the quality would n't be as good as skb . i was wrong. < br / > < br / > this case feels solid . handles are solid . i have many skb cases . i like this seahorse very much .
__label__positive__ a cheaper gopro alternative than seems to be well made with two separate screw holes ( for some reason ) .
__label__positive__ i have n't turned it off since i got it ! i think it can do way more than i needed but am very happy i purchased it !
__label__positive__ great tripod ! inexpensive , but works well for iphone 6+ and my nikon d300 .
__label__positive__ bruce anderson , he so awosome . he so helpful me alot .
__label__positive__ great product , the adjustment/pivot wheel is a bit weak though . when you put weights in the weight bag to counter the fully extended pole the pivot point bends . not sure how long the thing will last .
__label__negative__ does not fit a sony rx100 but even if it did , i do n't think i trust the velcro enough to keep my camera dry .
__label__negative__ after having used these for an afternoon they are going back . would like to recommend but at least this sample had ghosting reflections and the multicoatings were either not there or defective . too bad too the focus and other mechanisms were pretty nice . the spin up eye cups very nice . just poor coatings ymmv .
__label__positive__ looks nice . easy to put on camera . you need to adjust it to your needs .
__label__positive__ this hard case is well protected my instax printer . like it .
__label__positive__ received on time.. product quality is good for the price.. thanks..
__label__positive__ this is my favorite lens in the group of seven rokinon primes that i have so far ( 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 35 , 50 , & 85mm ) . they 're all ds except for the 12mm ( a cv version ) , which was a fisheye in the ds style . i wanted minimal distortion at that f/l. < br / > quite sharp and a good general purpose f/l for my gh-4 . it 's going to see a lot of use .
__label__positive__ a set like this is a must . included are any kind of mounting pieces that you may use . there are so many ways this allows you to mount it . the body strap feels very secure and it does n't bounce or sway around much . it is easy to put on and the go pro just clips in . i really like the bike mounting one as well . it is easy to install and does n't move around at all . this is a great deal if you plan on doing some recording and they all can be stored in a compact manner. < br / > i received this product for my unbiased review .
__label__positive__ i 've never used a polarizer before , and i 'm very happy with the result . this product feels sturdy and well made . the threads are very smooth , the glass is very clear , and i was surprised that there is no vignetting until as wide as about 24mm on my aps-c sensor . the microfiber cloth was a nice bonus .
__label__positive__ richard helped me with setting everything up . its soooo simple and easy and now i can watch my apartment from my latop or my phone for free ! i love this camera . the quality is amazing
__label__neutral__ the video quality on this camera is absolutely clear . it looks as if you 're in the room . however , even when the room is absolutely quiet , there is this buzzing noise that comes out of the camera . i could n't get rid of it even after i reset it a couple of times . in addition , i was hoping to be able to create multiple accounts so that i would n't be the only one with access to it . that 's not the case . if i want someone else to be able to see it , like my mom who is overseas , i would have to give her my log in information for my account , and still it would n't work because her phone would have to be near the camera for the initial set up . it 's good that the camera comes with a slot for a memory card , for local video recording in the event that it detected motion or sound but that 's not enough to for me too keep the camera . also , you ca n't remotely move the camera to look around the room . the wide able helps somewhat but you would have to zoom in on the area in question and it only has digital zoom of which i am not a fan .
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid : aa145e1b786380d9812f61cc38b858e4 ] ] this was my fourth security camera till i finally settled . i almost returned this one when i first got it. < br / > < br / > when i first got it , the video quality was okay and the viewing angle was limited . the video was intermittent and the recorded videos kept deleting itself despite the settings i put in . at this point i was frustrated and really did n't want to have to go through a return process of a device not working properly . i want to share an important note that you can not contact dahua when it comes to tech support . you will have to contact the seller . which really sucks because most of them do n't care. < br / > < br / > anyway i contacted the seller and he sent me a firmware update and fortunately that fixed 95 % of the issues . suddenly the viewing angle was increased and the quality is amazing . the videos no longer deletes itself and the plugin for the browser also fixed itself . however , i still have a problem trying to get it to email me if there was any alerts . i 've had it working with two previous dahuas but not this one . i contacted the seller , but they never replied so i gave up for the time being. < br / > < br / > to simplify ... < br / > < br / > pros : great video quality < br / > great wide angle < br / > sd card storage < br / > works on firefox and chrome no problem if you do n't like ie < br / > ir goes pretty far out < br / > < br / > con < br / > support will suck unless you get a good seller < br / > this came out of the box with lots of problems . hopefully your seller will be happy to assist you. < br / > < br / > the major drawback for me is that several months later i still ca n't get the smtp to work. < br / > the main reason i chose dahua was because with their software , i should n't need a separate software or a dedicated server . fortunately that 's true , but with the email problem , it 's not at 100 % . still , with the quality and the sd storage . it does a good job . i uploaded a night and day video combined . i have yet to get audio working and i did n't really need it , but since it has audio , it would be nice to try it out . i asked the seller about how to set it up and what to buy , but of course , they did n't reply . i believe it will be better to call them than email which was what i 've been doing. < br / > < br / > all in all , the camera is really good and the angle is just exactly what i wanted . sd storage is a must ! hard to get all three of these requests together . very happy with my purchase . unfortunately has some minor problems and support is ... .eh.it , but since it has audio , it would be nice to try it out . i asked the seller about how to set it up and what to buy , but of course , they did n't reply . i believe it will be better to call them than email which was what i 've been doing. < br / > < br / > all in all , the camera is really good and the angle is just exactly what i wanted . sd storage is a must ! hard to get all three of these requests together . very happy with my purchase . unfortunately has some minor problems and support is ... .eh .
__label__positive__ works fine
__label__neutral__ dimer broker after 7th time used
__label__positive__ arrived fast and worked as i had planned .
__label__positive__ nice cover piece ! !
__label__positive__ buy one ! having so much fun with this . seems to work with all of my lenses , minus some vignetting on certain ones .
__label__negative__ stop working after the 2nd day .
__label__positive__ what can i say teenager !
__label__positive__ as with all of the black rapid products , this is well thought out and a perfect addition to the strap . it is large enough to hold two batteries , several cf cards , and a filter . for my nikon d300 .
__label__negative__ they never worked i 'm so upset , i 've bought different spyglasses and have worked well , but this purchase was sadly a mistake .
__label__positive__ batteries were sent quickly and work fine . i am busy taking pictures again .
__label__positive__ love , love , love ! ! ! i purchased this camera in 2010 and this is working perfectly fine till date . i purchased few lenses . and they work great with it . price has been dropped and that a great deal at less price . if you are new to dslr and want to buy one . this is great for beginners . i will probably move to another upgrade version at some point but rt now this is it . pair it with tripod and few gud lenses .
__label__positive__ my 18 year old and my 13 year old traveled to toyko japan and manila , p.i . for the summer vacation . my teenager daughter got awesome videos using the gopro while riding the wooden sailboats in the phillipines .
__label__positive__ this was a great tripod for the price range . just high enough that you can film people with the camera at face level . very easy to use , no complaints at all !
__label__positive__ these , are the best cloths i have found to clean glass , tv screens , and camera lenses . will purchase more in the future .
__label__positive__ this was everything i needed it to be . it is a great small tripod good for webcam or still digital camera . it holds the camera steady and is easy to adjust .
__label__positive__ wonderful product and well made .
__label__positive__ so many attachments i will never use them all great deal
__label__positive__ i 'm just starting out with my dslr caverage so i do not have tons of equipment but for what i do havery this has been perfect . also travels well and has enough space for odds and ends without having to bring anew extra.bag for personals . great purchase
__label__positive__ it 's a winner , slow on 18650s , but definitely a 5 star device
__label__positive__ love , love , love !
__label__positive__ the best camera for vlogging . the wide angle ( although fisheye ) is very good quality and has many options when it comes to filming. < br / > the best part about this though is the audio . perfect sound 100 % of the time , it is crazy how well the microphones work .
__label__positive__ good camera .
__label__positive__ great product and the quality of the pi8ctures are great
__label__positive__ i have used this lens several times to shoot wildlife with my nikon d3300 . the pictures came out very good . a good price and good pictures for me .
__label__positive__ great value , wish that camera was more wide angle .
__label__positive__ awesome wide lens for the sony a6000 , highly recommended . great for landscapes and city architecture shots . i 've used it in las vegas and at the valley of fire and had great results. < br / > < br / > the image below was taken with this lens on a sony a6000 and is a three shot bracketed image , enhanced in photomatix pro .
__label__positive__ this lens is really amazing ! took it our a couple nights to take pictures of the stars ! i did buy it on bh . not because of a price difference . only because i knew for sure that i 'd get a new lens from bh .
__label__neutral__ a little bit small for my camera
__label__positive__ hold nice and tight
__label__positive__ a ton of great mounts and the case is great to put it all it
__label__positive__ always good to have extra power !
__label__negative__ beware - does not fit the remote control for the dji phantom 3 .
__label__positive__ i picked this up for my canon mk2 and works great ... ... ... instructions not top of line but product works for me
__label__positive__ yes , i like this camera , its perfect for my real estate work . good quality , and my 2nd coolpix .
__label__positive__ batteries and charger were both a good price and seem to work just fine .
__label__positive__ awesome deal ! !
__label__positive__ although i chose not to keep my lens kit , the quality and amount of items included in the kit were unexpected ! the company was extremely helpful and we 're wonderful to work with . i will be back for any other items i need of this kind in the future !
__label__negative__ this did n't work for me . the corners of the photo was shaded . destroyed use of pictures . be forewarned .
__label__positive__ loving it ! , i bought this camera just before we went to berlin germany , the pictures come out great ! you can use the programs on the camera to adjust your shots . from the first time i saw this camera at costco i really liked it , but even though they had it for $ 199.00 off it was still a little to much . i got it for a lot less , my only regret is that , i should it got it in black .
__label__positive__ show
__label__neutral__ it has been having some problems
__label__positive__ great bargin. , so many more angles than i could possible get by myself
__label__positive__ wonderful . purchased for a alaskan cruise , and the worked great . nice size . waterproof . perfect wildlife viewing power and object lens size .
__label__positive__ works as described
__label__positive__ thank you !
__label__positive__ works as advertised . good build .
__label__positive__ just as good as the one that came with my quadcoptor !
__label__positive__ works great , but i wish i had read the information better , c only no f
__label__positive__ it 's very cute ! if you like twin stars , then you have to get this !
__label__positive__ considering the price of a hoya cpl filter , this works great , cuts glare , enhances colors , makes the blue sky more blue and the clouds stand out .
__label__positive__ i 'll take two !
__label__neutral__ works well , takes time to learn the app but once you understand it works great . the cord could be a bit longer as the curly cord is a little stif .
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ probably one of the most underrated camera 's canon ever made . it 's fantastic , especially at these prices it 's fantastic deal . the 22mm lens is amazing .
__label__positive__ good tool works for me
__label__positive__ great tool to have in my arsenal of photo/video tools .
__label__positive__ work great look good and i like it .
__label__positive__ it is ok , have not actually broken in yet therefore will not know how long the battery will last .
__label__positive__ excellent product ! reliable merchant . highly recommended . a+
__label__positive__ worked well as a replacement battery
__label__positive__ exactly what i was looking for . i bought this for a trip to mongolia . i was considering shoving a camera bag in the bottom of my regular backpack , but realized i would n't be able to get to my camera or changes lenses that way without difficulty . i also wanted something that did n't scream & # 34 ; camera bag & # 34 ; so that i would n't draw the attention of thieves . this worked perfectly . you could n't fit a long lens it in very well , but the biggest i have is a 300 so it was perfect for me . i was able to carry 4 lenses and the camera body in the bottom portion . the top is a little small , but i was able to fit a book , journal , kindle , gloves , beanie hat , some snacks , and a rolled up rain jacket in there , which was all i needed for a day bag anyway . there were times when side access to the camera portion would have been nice , but all in all this was just about perfect for me . when i was n't wearing it , the bag ( containing camera ) got packed on a yak and despite the jostling , nothing was damaged .
__label__positive__ extremely surprised - super great sound quality . appears is little cheap ( pastic wise ) , but does the job . used them on my canon 70d . picks up great sounds from the back of an auditorium ( 80-100ft ) .
__label__positive__ love it
__label__negative__ this is a great all-rounder lens - no doubt . but that is downplayed by the flimsy mounting system that shakes , rattles and disconnects the electronics . the locking mechanism stub in the camera does n't fit snug with the slot in the lens . there is a significant play between the lens and camera that is annoying when turning the zoom ring . had turn off and on once in every half hour to reconnect the electronics between the camera and lens. < br / > < br / > i would not recommend anyone to buy this lens unless sony fix this issue .
__label__negative__ not a good one
__label__positive__ had everything i wanted and more very pleased
__label__positive__ great product
__label__negative__ the camera does not take clear pictures . i can no longer return it and ca n't get a hold of the seller .
__label__negative__ very good and i would recommend bshiraha
__label__positive__ these are a perfect fit for my nest cams . it does not appear to affect the view at all . the mount is simple and easy . in fact , i think it 's a better and easier mounting system than what came originally with the nest cameras . i bought one of there for each of my eight cameras and am very pleased .
__label__positive__ product worked as intended .
__label__positive__ the best of many tripods i 've used over the years
__label__positive__ bang for buck ca n't go wrong
__label__positive__ the flash work beautiful with my camera . have it professional output .
__label__neutral__ blue tooth often losses connection
__label__positive__ it seems like the spotting scope is good enough for the pistol range although i have not used it yet .
__label__positive__ i took this camera to london , paris , istanbul , and doha . it performed wonderfully . it does all of the basics well , and has some nice added features ( like a pop up flash . ) this is the best camera i 've ever owned in this price range .
__label__positive__ works great and great price
__label__positive__ this is a great design for the fuji x100t . feels solid in the hand and the thread at the bottom sits flush so when you put the camera down it lies flat . easy access to the battery and memory card . and the texture on the grip keeps the camera secure in your hand . i recommend the thumb grip with this as they really go hand in hand .
__label__positive__ as a gift for a 7 year old boy this was a big hit . easy to operate . the styrofoam type body wo n't hurt walls etc
__label__positive__ just what i needed . worked great !
__label__positive__ i think they are great , could not find them locally , my camera works great , thank you so much for having them ... .
__label__positive__ have bought wasabi kits for several of my cameras . they all work flawlessly .
__label__positive__ best grip for rollercoasters video
__label__positive__ the easiest security camera there is to use and monitor . i love these . i have two now in addition to a separate camera system , which i realize now i did n't need when i got these . the only drawback is that if you want to take full advantage of their capabilities such as storing up to a months worth of high quality video you need to subscribe to their plan , but it is well worth it and very affordable like around $ 15 per month for the first camera and half that for the second camera but it gives 30 days of recording which is easily editable which you could give to law enforcement or insurance if needed . without a subscription you get a days worth of recorded video which may meet your needs . awesome cameras .
__label__positive__ good buy
__label__positive__ fits perfectly with my glasses on . not easy to install on a d90 but with a little extra force , made it to fit . i mostly shoot outdoors so having less light coming from the side of your eye helps a lot .
__label__positive__ nice protection for the gopro .
__label__positive__ this was an incredible and unbelievabe deal i have never had at amazon.com . firstly , allow me to take a moment to thank the seller and amazon.com to make the such good deal possible . i communicated with the seller ( goja ) a couple of times before i place the order , about the condition of the lens , about the package contents . the seller replied quickly and patiently answered all my concerns . and then the package came as described . i have been with b & h for more than ten years , and had all my photographing equipments from them . now i think i am big fan of goja as well. < br / > < br / > let 's talk about the package for moment here . the package includes the lens itself , brand new , a set of lens fielters with pouch , a sling bag , a remote for certain model of nikon cameras , a dust blower , a dust brush , some cleaning patches , a lanyard for the lens cap , and a cleaning cloth , if i did n't miss anything . including all those bonus items , the lens still priced at regular price of the lens only . that 's amazing . i have been following up this lens since it introduced , i think there is no need for me to review the specs of lens again , since there are literally tons of perfect and very detailed reviews out there about this & # 34 ; dark technology & # 34 ; lens . just one thing i would like to mention , is that i have a old d2x 's from long ago , i bought this lens solely for it , and made this old timer shine its value again . well this camera gives me too much memory , and this lens makes all those memory continue , and better . for all those bonus accessories , i only tried the set of filters so far , they are good enough for my uses , if they are not at top quality. < br / > so , again , thank goja and amazon.com to help me have my dream coming true , and have my good memories coming better .
__label__positive__ fortunately there support atrocious
__label__neutral__ not what i expected .
__label__positive__ terry morgan was able to help me quickly and walk me through the set up of this camera . i have viewed it from my home and it looks great , i will now try to view from my iphone and report back my results. < br / > < br / > the tech service was great , very smart people and very friendly- thanks for the support !
__label__positive__ it makes the handling of the camera is very easy
__label__positive__ does the job , inexpensive . just make sure it click on tight otherwise you risk lens falling off when zooming or focusing manually
__label__positive__ camera works great as expected . simple to use . i believe this is the best bundle for the price . the lens is sufficient for usage in most situations . as for the other items in the package i believe this seems to be the best of the bunch . the others may offer more items but most of those items will rarely be used unless you are a professional photographer . i may buy another longer lens later for my son 's football games , but for now , this is doing just fine .
__label__positive__ have n't used in water yet ... ..looks good but wish went a little smaller when tightened .
__label__positive__ i purchased this for my son 's rehearsal dinner . i tested and it took great pics . i liked it so much i purchased twice as much film as needed . i also purchased the little lens for selfies/close-ups . i may buy another camera !
__label__positive__ when u take picture with this camera make sure u have the right setting because if u do n't ur photo does n't develop as good . this camera is a perfect size to bring in trips or when u r hanging out with ur friends ! if u purchase this camera u r sooo lucky and the camera is super fun to use !
__label__positive__ very happy and great price
__label__positive__ great filter . comes in a hard plastic case . excellent product , excellent value ! : ^ )
__label__positive__ great camera / fantastic customer support from vendor ip cam central < br / > the camera setup was easy , i struggled with router and browser set up . life would have been a lot easier if i read the manual ( go figure ) . < br / > again , ip cam central was great .
__label__positive__ worked exactly as written .
__label__neutral__ this flash does n't work with the yongnuo yn-622c triggers both on-camera ( ttl pass through ) as well as off-camera ( remote mode ) . i have tested it multiple times , multiple configurations ad multiple resets , but no use . i bought a neewer/voking vk581 [ [ asin : b00nqo4bp2 neewer e-ttl master slave speedlite flashlight *high-speed sync* for canon rebel t5i t4i t3i t3 t2i t1i sl1 , eos 700d 650d 600d 1100d 550d 500d 100d 300d 350d 400d 5d mark iii 5d mark ii 7d 30d 40d 50d and all other canon models ] ] and it worked splendidly without any excuses both on and off camera with the yongnuo triggers . of course , the yh-700c belongs to this category of full featured flashes when compared to the neewer/voking but still , i expected this to work . i have also ordered a neewer 622c [ [ asin : b00qbxpcx0 neewer nw622c fsk 2.4ghz 7 channel wireless e-ttl high speed sync flash transceiver trigger and receiver for canon 5d mark ii , 5d mark iii , 1ds mark iii , 1d mark iv , 1d mark iii , 7d , 60d , 50d , 40d , 450d/xsi , 500d/t1i , 550d/t2i , 600d/t3i , 650d/t4i , 1000d/xs , 1100d/t3 ; canon 5d , 10d , 20d , 30d , 300d , 350d , 1d , 1d mark ii cameras ; canon 600ex , 580ex , 580ex ii , 430ex , 430ex ii , 320ex , 270ex , 270ex ] ] which looks exactly as the yongnuo triggers to try and see if they work with this flash but i really doubt it . with the yongnuo , it can only be used with the in-flash settings and can not be controlled remotely and neither can the menu be changed remotely from the camera . only the flash trigger pin gets activated and the settings do not pass in any modes . the camera flash itself works fine when controlled with the in-flash menu and the flash light although seems powerful , somehow feels a lot less powerful than the voking at the same power levels . i would say , 1/1 of the voking nearly blinds you even if aimed away from you but 1/1 of the aperlite is still agreeably bright to look at when held away from your eyes , just not as bright . menu settings are good , easy to access and change . overall , i giveit a 3 star since i can only control it on-camera and not off camera , with just one flash . of couse , i can have this in slave mode and use another flash to control it or use a ttl cord to extend it a little more than a few feet but not real wireless . the yh-700c on the other hand , seems to work with the yongnuo as mentioned in the gadgeeter review . http : //the-gadgeteer.com/2015/05/21/aperlite-yh-700c-camera-flash-review/ hope this helps someone since i spent more than a week asking people all around the internet and posting questions even under the yongnuo products but no one had a proper answer . *update : this works well with the neewer nw-622c flash trigger . for a lesser price the yongnuo , the neewer seems to support all the features the yongnuo supports and also better it in handling and speedlite support . one thing i did notice is that it gives 1 or 2 stops lesser light than the neewer/voking mode . i think i might be returning this and get another voking since it seems to support a lot of features which i might use sometime later and also seems to be supported by other triggers . : )
__label__positive__ it is perfect . this i exactly what i wanted . the camera is a gem .
__label__positive__ works as expected . great to have the camera working again .
__label__positive__ the lens works well and as expected . however , not only did they send me a 58mm uv filter instead of 52mm as described , the description also recommended a 40.5mm-52mm step up ring ( which i bought ) and i found out that the lens is 49mm anyway , so the ring is totally useless to me . i will either return the ring and buy a 49-58 step-up ring or return the ring and buy a 49mm filter and then sell the 58mm filter . i do n't know if everyone gets the same kit and the description was a mistake or they just package a random size filter . quite a hassle . i 'm feeling 3.5 stars if i could .
__label__negative__ after reading up on this security camera i decided not to waste my time . returned un-opened and put my money back in my pocket .
__label__positive__ good product ! ! !
__label__positive__ this is very versatile for mounting lightweight a/v gear in all sorts of locations . i 'd agree with other reviewers that you have to use common sense about what you clamp it to and not overload it. < br / > the construction is sturdy ; more metal than plastic . the clamp operates easily and tightens down securely . the ball head has a good range of adjustment and is also quite secure. < br / > i use this for a palm-size camcorder ( 380g , 13.4 oz . ) and a [ [ asin : b00kcxmbes portable audio recorder ] ] ( 176g , 6.2 oz . ) , and i 've had zero concerns about mounting these lightweight items in precarious locations . the manufacturer says the capacity is 1.36 kg ( 3 lb . ) and with valuable equipment i would respect that and leave room to spare ( common sense ) . < br / > as for mounting on a moving object , i 'd only do it if the object moved smoothly without abrupt changes in speed or direction ( again , common sense ) . < br / > the mount is most secure when clamped to something with parallel faces that contacts as much of the rubber pads as possible . at a recent gig i had the option of putting this clamp on a pipe and decided against it , even with my relatively light gear . better safe than sorry. < br / > all in all , this is an essential item in my bag of specialty camera mounts .
__label__positive__ i 'm using ravelli stands for many years . it 's well built stands for all video works i do- holding lights and mics. < br / > i 'm abusing it very hardly and it lasts for me exactly to years , then i buy again and i 'm very happy with ravelli stands .
__label__positive__ works fine . sharp image . audio record is fine too . hdmi cable included so i can see the recorded video in any tv . can record over and over so theres no need to format .
__label__positive__ keeps my gopro 4 going , charges fast with my anker chargers .
__label__positive__ pretty sharp for the price . this lens does n't get a lot of use but is pretty sharp the times i 've used it . ca n't compare it to the limited lens but i 'd guess it 's pretty close optically . the build quality feels fine , very light .
__label__positive__ great it works
__label__positive__ these sunglasses are outstanding they 're great i have n't had any problems whatsoever i would just like to say thank you for such a great product at such a great price
__label__positive__ its tiny , but it will work great and holds my s5 even with an otterbox on it .
__label__positive__ good product
__label__positive__ works well enough for the price and will get me by until i need something more powerful with intensity control for a hair light .
__label__positive__ love it ! works right out of the box . i would give this as a gift to anyone including my mom who has no tech skills
__label__negative__ i 'm torn on this and hopefully my main issue with these cameras will be resolved by arlo with some software fix . the install is a breeze and the wireless aspect is just fantastic - i was able to place my cameras outside exactly where i wanted them without worrying about electrical outlets . the picture is excellent and they pick up my wifi from the opposite end of the house and outdoors . great ! here 's my problem - and judging from internet chat it 's a problem shared by many : there is a three second or so delay between the camera registering movement and then starting to record . this puts a security camera like this in the & # 34 ; what 's the point ? & # 34 ; category . three seconds after motion is detected is an eternity ! in most cases , the & # 34 ; event & # 34 ; has passed ! on one of my two cameras , if i pull into my driveway the recording shows the car already parked ! on the other camera , if i walk to my car from the front door , i 'm out of camera range before the recording starts ! this totally negates the reason to have a security camera . if a bad guy walks up to your front door he 's kicked it in before the camera records ! the alerts i get on my phone always show ... nothing - because the event itself has long passed . not good but hopefully there will be a fix !
__label__positive__ held a go-pro on my windshield and truck hood while off roading . never failed .
__label__positive__ good for this price
__label__positive__ nice
__label__neutral__ the case is nice but measure your camera before you purchase it . some coolpix cameras do not fit into it . we have one that does not , but is not listed as one that does n't fit . we are keeping the case because it is inexpensive and can be used to carry some small items in our hiking backpack .
__label__positive__ works , but takes some time entering fingerprints . once the prints are in , it reads them fairly well .
__label__negative__ it broke my $ 400 lens .
__label__positive__ nice
__label__positive__ i love my camera so much ! ! ! perfect christmas gift ! ! the lenses and shutter do n't give meach any issues ! the caring case is on the bigger side of what i 'd like . but then i can keep everything together .
__label__neutral__ i 've had these ( both 58mm and 52mm versions ) for a while now . i bought for about 2x the price of the neewer version after getting that one and returning it due to low quality . the ice hd version seems higher quality than the neewer , but after taking a trip to the beach recently i realized just how much images are affected by using these . i took a bunch of shots with and without the filters after noticing lack of detail on several images . at first i thought something was wrong with my camera or lens ( canon 70d and was using 55-250 is lens ) but after digging into it i concluded it was all the cpl filter . i took test images without filter , with filter at minimum effect , and with filter at maximum effect . only the images without filter were sharp . no matter how the filter was turned it degraded image quality. < br / > < br / > conclusion : cuts glare , darkens sky , deepens color of water , etc . as advertised . works great for landscape type shots for the overall look of the picture . however , if you zoom in to full crop for a detailed view you can see all edges are very soft and lack detail . this basically ruined all the shots that i took at full zoom hoping to crop them later . i 've read other reviews that say you get what you pay for and that is true in this case . if you just want the polarized look , this product will probably suit your needs . if image quality and detail matters , spend significantly more money and buy a better brand like b & w or hoya . they are still too much money for me at the time , but at least i now fully understand the & # 34 ; cost & # 34 ; of using the cheap ones .
__label__positive__ great microphone .
__label__positive__ priced right works great.was a bit concerned when i discovered that the rear hatch door on the expedition was all plastic rendering the magnet useless , but wait they included a velcro sticky thing so all is well . will update after our camping trip in the near future .
__label__negative__ i 've used a bunch of these units and like them a lot but they do have a tendency to crash and then you need to reboot the hard drive loosing all the data on it . set up for the qr code could n't be simpler though . go to network settings then enable the nat , then go to the info tab on the first page of menu and select information . if you have downloaded the superlivepro app from the store then open the app and find the add tab select scan and scan the qr code in the information tab of the dvr . connect to the internet and you 're connected . the only problem is that it 's so slow and unreliable even tech service has recommended not to use it but do the port forwarding in order to set it up . if you 're not a computer person who can make changes to a router you wo n't get this thing set up . tech service is available after 12:30pm eastern time ( there in california ) the company seems pretty bad since it does n't offer service during normal east coast hours . the app is amazing though and that 's why i continue to use it . the reasons i give it a 1 star is because of the qr code and the horrible tech service provided .
__label__positive__ great gift !
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ this lens is very clear and sharp . very nice pictures . i would have given it 5 stars , but it is very noisy during af . this noise will be caught by the camera during video .
__label__positive__ so far , it seems to be a pretty decent video camera .
__label__positive__ fit well . good quality
__label__positive__ it works .
__label__positive__ best idea ever
__label__positive__ this camera is so much fun and it takes the best pictures if you know how to use it correctly !
__label__positive__ simple yet effective . it is a plastic rain coat for your camera . fits my canon 70d with 70-200mm lens. < br / > no need to spend your money on a more expensive item .
__label__positive__ good fast service , and seems to be a real good product ! no complaints thx !
__label__positive__ it works !
__label__positive__ excelent product ... it work great on my first scuba diving ! !
__label__positive__ this thing flies extremely stable and very easily . video looks pretty nice but no night vision at all . the battery allows you to fly approx . 7 1/2 minutes .
__label__positive__ excellent cameras . the video is extra sharp , and they are very easy to install .
__label__negative__ do n't waste your money on this garbage . very poor .
__label__negative__ it did n't work . i got a refund from amazon .
__label__negative__ description claimed that it had been tested and worked ... it did not and i wasted $ 30 on film
__label__positive__ have n't tried everything yet , but good so far
__label__positive__ got this camera for my son who is studying photojournalism . he loves this camera .
__label__neutral__ power button broke during first use . went back to the original clear case .
__label__negative__ terrible product - cheap - could n't get it off my lens after i installed it !
__label__positive__ good enough
__label__positive__ all what it said it would do.recommended to others .
__label__negative__ did n't work . prevented nearby z-wave devices from working . the web site said something about a firmware update that can only be done on a windows machine . i do n't have windows os . not being an os snob i just do n't have one and i 'm not going to get one just to get my outdoor sensor to work . wish i would have had time to test it before i the return window ran out .
__label__positive__ it works very well
__label__positive__ the s1 is all i expected and more . i am pleased with it . the 50x worked fine picking up a pilot boat leaving a container ship in the evening . how ever the slave flash did not work , but amazon more than corrected the problem . i have a very good camera through a customer focused company .
__label__positive__ excellent product ideal when you dont have enough time to charge both batteries .
__label__positive__ excellent ! ! ! < br / > it was just what we wanted
__label__positive__ learning is half of the journey .
__label__positive__ super
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ i bought this b & w nd 3.0 filter to replace my lee & # 34 ; big stopper & # 34 ; which was optically fine for my purposes . my main issue was the threading on the lee filter . i usually had to make at least several attempts to screw the lee filter onto a lens . on the other hand , the threading on this very well constructed b & w filter is so good that it practically screws itself onto a lens . sure , this b & w filter costs considerably more than the well priced lee filter , but when time is of the essence i do n't want to be & # 34 ; screwing & # 34 ; around trying to get a filter onto a lens . also , this b & w filter is easier to clean than the lee filter . in some cases , when possible , i 'll just spend the extra cash where quality , performance , and convenience are a concern .
__label__positive__ great sturdy bag ,
__label__positive__ exactly as described . great quality paper !
__label__negative__ very sticky and messy . never again .
__label__negative__ this camera was ok but does not do well in low light conditions .
__label__negative__ while this worked well to keep glair from the side from interfering with the viewfinder , i found the rubber cup kept getting pulled off the frame it sits in every time i put the camera into its bag , and at other inopportune times . i ended up losing the cup , and i wo n't replace it .
__label__positive__ i really like the product itself , but ca n't give anything 5 stars that has drawn as many negative comments and horror stories for it 's lack of customer service and support . read the reviews that deal with that aspect before considering purchasing something that could become a very expensive paper weight .
__label__positive__ the quality is decent for the price .
__label__positive__ love love love our gopro ! we use it on our motorcycle and it is awesome
__label__positive__ i use this quite a lot . works well ... .
__label__positive__ good price and quality
__label__negative__ i bought this camera and found it would not work . i sent it back and was refunded , no problem . i ended up buying a newer panasonic camera and have been very happy with the quality of pictures it takes . my only problem is how dirt is taken into the camera via the lens extending and when it contracts back into place , it takes with it any dirt , dust or sand in the environment , which eventually results in that same dirt , dust and sand on the inner lens and recorded on your pictures .
__label__positive__ if you are looking for an inexpensive , but trustworthy tripod ! i could not recommend this one enough ! i thought that if i bought something cheap my camera would tip the whole thing over but that is not the case ! definitely get 's the job done !
__label__positive__ these microfiber wipes are very good for cleaning stuff around the house . i keep one for my glasses , one for my car , and one for my phone and computer monitor . i recommend .
__label__neutral__ it is not what i expected , the pictures i have taken are blurry
__label__positive__ love my selfie stick !
__label__positive__ love it
__label__positive__ excellent product !
__label__positive__ excellent accessory . the installation is easy and the camera records it perfectly .
__label__neutral__ lens are ok
__label__positive__ super bright . took it out in the woods at night and for like 2-300 feet , it looked like day . crazy bright and super deal . thinking of getting a lot more to put on my car for offroad lights . just kidding . but seriously . super deal and really great light for the price . why are you still reading ? just buy it already !
__label__positive__ the es-68 is a locking bayonet hood designed for the [ [ asin : b00x8mrbcw canon ef 50 1.8 stm ] ] . it offers protection from glare , raindrops and the occasional stray doggie nose. < br / > < br / > it fits snuggly in the groove , twisting on with a firm and confident feel . the lock prevents the hood from working loose due to rubbing or light whacks . to release , simply press the lock tab and turn . fit and finish are excellent : quality plastic , fingerprint resistant matte black exterior and flat black interior to nix reflections ( paint , not rayon flocking ) . plus , the exterior finish is perfectly matched to the ef 50 1.8 stm lens . the hood can be reverse mounted for compact storage. < br / > < br / > why buy the es-68 when generic metal hoods are available at a fraction of the price ? the ef 50 1.8 stm uses a nested barrel that extends during focus . attaching a generic hood to the filter threads of the nested barrel is risky since a frontal blow or pressure might damage the focus mechanism . the es-68 attaches to the main ( outer ) barrel , thereby protecting the protruding inner barrel from impact and pressure. < br / > < br / > the es-68 works great but is a bit pricy when you consider that canon omitted rayon flocking and moved production offshore ( malaysia ) to reduce costs . however , after shooting without a hood for two months , i 'm relieved to stop being careful with the front element and fiddling with a lens cap .
__label__negative__ hello ! this is jen , the customer service manager for peak design. < br / > < br / > this product is a poor-quality fake version of our product , cuff < br / > < br / > while imitation is said to be the best form flattery , we feel it is our duty to caution you about these products . we were & # 34 ; & # 34 ; fortunate & # 34 ; & # 34 ; enough to acquire one of these units at our headquarters in san francisco and put it through the same inspections and testing procedures we use on our products . it comes with your standard array of fake attributes : substandard materials , poor workmanship , no attention to detail and a lot of mechanical sluggishness that typically accompanies imitations. < br / > < br / > most alarmingly , several of the faults on this product can directly lead to a catastrophic failure , i.e . the dropping of your camera . the cords used on this product are simple nylon and will fail after reoccurring use . our cords are made with a custom woven dyneema that is meant to withstand the repetitive wear that comes with using a camera . it took us years to develop and design this cord and without it , these straps will not safely hold your camera . this is n't a piece of a equipment you should go cheap on. < br / > < br / > fakes are a part of doing business in a global market , we 're not unaware of that . and while we will likely pursue action through courts if it becomes a large enough issue , for now we 'll just pass along this word of caution. < br / > < br / > from all of us at peak design , we thank you for your years of loyal patronage . we 'll get back to making products now ; )
__label__positive__ for the price this is a really good product . for a big production professional one it would be upwards of $ 2000 so i 'm happy .
__label__negative__ cameras work fine but could n't get it to send messages/alerts to my phone/email . also the hard drive failed in less than a year .
__label__positive__ they exceeded my expectations !
__label__positive__ perfect , lightweight selfie stick . plugs in to phone and has button to take photo , no need to use timer . i received this product at a discount for my honest unbiased review .
__label__positive__ excelent choice
__label__positive__ we have a lot of windows in an area of our and so far this thing will go if any large crash happens next to it . great way to test , have kids stop feet next to it and it will go off . synched up with frontpoint no problem
__label__positive__ these things are affordable , are easy to pair with smart things , show when a door opens immediately , and also have physical contacts so you can wire multiple reed switches to them . for example , i 'm in the process of wiring three windows and one door with physical reed switches and i 'll have one & # 34 ; zone & # 34 ; monitored by one ecolink . as far as i 'm concerned , if any of these items are open it 's a big issue for me so i 'm ok having them wired to one zone and not knowing whether it 's a basement window or door - a break in is a break in , and this ability to have zones saves me a significant amount of money .
__label__positive__ very functional and fits the camera perfect .
__label__positive__ great picture on camera . i made changes and needed tech support . they were great. < br / > walter helped me rest camera and set up remote access successfully .
__label__negative__ you get what you pay for . the thing wobbles and does n't hold the phone upright . i will say the company offered to replace my item , but i think it 's just a cheap item and it was n't worth my time to keep getting replacements sent out .
__label__positive__ best one
__label__neutral__ the manufacturer 's website recommends : before purchasing the nvr kit , it is recommended to take a wifi device ( such as a laptop or a cellphone ) , and hold that wifi device in the approximate area where you plan on installing a camera . if the wi-fi device receives a strong wi-fi signal from your router , then the ip camera will also receive a strong signal . ( make sure a cellphone is looking at wifi not cell signal . i used my wi-fi ipad ) i did n't know this when ordering , but the cameras communicate by wi-fi direct , the cables only provide power ! it would not work in our house with a foil vapor barrier . . .
__label__positive__ works as it should .
__label__positive__ i like it ... .and it is really good to use..
__label__positive__ great cheap , little camera . takes great pictures , awesome built in special effects . it is amazingly light , 4oz i believe . great for backpacking , that 's why i got it . zooms not amazing , big suprise
__label__positive__ received item in a timely manner . packaged nicely . can finally download my pictures . i am a happy camper ! !
__label__positive__ works like if it had coming from canon .
__label__positive__ delivered as stated , packaging was great and batteries charged and work in my camera .
__label__positive__ very happy with this purchase . everything came in working order and was as advertised . was considering getting a gopro , but this was a fraction of the price . update : i 've had my camera for a couple weeks now , and i realized that one of the batteries is n't taking a charge . i was planning on getting a battery pack set with a external charger anyway , it looks like i need to now .
__label__positive__ just what i expected .
__label__positive__ this item arrived quickly and in excellent condition . it was exactly as the way it had been described - a great complement to my new camera .
__label__positive__ what a great camera . i purchased one just like this but a blue model . it had been reconditioned and sold through amazon warehouse and it worked for years . this summer the auto focus portion went 'kaput ' . i 've replaced it with this similar model . it is very easy to operate and the videos are outstanding ; clear and sharp . this camera is a no brainer and easy to use .
__label__negative__ did n't work
__label__positive__ exactly what i was looking for ... a camera case that did not disconnect from the camera when the camera is in use . it easily fit my smaller zoom and was a perfect fit for my canon 35-300 zoom .
__label__positive__ great camera
__label__positive__ works fine with my old nikon d5100 .
__label__positive__ awesome
__label__positive__ a great set . my daughter loves and and is having so much fun using it . thank you !
__label__positive__ works like it should and it is cheap but not to cheap . not as expensive as a hoya .
__label__neutral__ batteries are great but the charger is hard to use . the np-fv70 batteries do n't easily click into the charger and always take several attempts to get positioned correctly . i 'm constantly wondering if they 're locked in correctly . price was good , as was delivery . props to big mike 's for getting the package to me ahead of schedule , i 'd give big mike 's 5 stars if i could isolate the service they provided .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ i purchased this because i upgraded to a full frame camera . i used tokina 's dx version for years and absolutely loved it . i will never buy a nikon or other brand lens in this range because tokina nailed it . check the reviews and note that tokina 's lens does an equal , if not better , job against nikon 's own lens . then note the price difference. < br / > < br / > you will not be disappointed with this lens .
__label__positive__ we bought this microphone after three of our wireless mics gave out on us . this one is dependable and does a great job with sound . the audio is clear and static free !
__label__positive__ i still have my old camera . love the fact that i found this .
__label__positive__ i own hoya introductory kits for all of the camera lenses i own that will take one . they make top quality filters which you can be proud to own . these filters are constructed from optical glass within an aluminum-alloy frame , which protect the front element of a lens from scratches , bumps , or impacts . this kit includes everyday filters that all photographers should own regardless of skill level . it also includes a convenient carrying/storage filter pouch . details from the hoya website about the filters included in this kit : < br / > < br / > hoya uv filter < br / > < br / > - absorbs uv light and reduces bluish cast of daylight. < br / > - does not require adjustments to exposure while in use. < br / > - single coated to prevent internal ghosting and reflections while providing approximately 96 % light transmission. < br / > - creates no additional coloration or contrast. < br / > - general protection filter reduces dust , moisture , and scratches from reaching lens elements. < br / > < br / > hoya circular polarizer filter < br / > < br / > - helps to reduce reflections and glare by filtering out light that has become polarized due to reflection from a non-metallic surface. < br / > - polarizing filters arrange , and filter , directionally polarized light perpendicularly to the reflected light , allowing for the absorption of much of the light. < br / > - clears up haze in distant landscapes and provides more saturated , vivid colors. < br / > - strongest effect when used at a 90° angle from the sun. < br / > - circular polarizers are ideal for use with digital cameras and autofocus lenses where a linear polarizer will often disrupt auto exposure and focus features. < br / > - non-coated < br / > - approximately 96 % average light transmission. < br / > - 3 to 4x filter factor reduces exposure by 1.6 to 2 stops. < br / > - note : the thickness of this filter 's frame is slimmer than the one sold in the kit this one replaces ( filter kit set i ) < br / > < br / > hoya ndx8 nd ( neutral density ) filter < br / > < br / > - enables slow shutter speeds to be used , especially with fast films , to record movement in subjects such as waterfalls , clouds , cars , seas etc. < br / > - decreases depth of field by allowing wider apertures to be used , which helps separate subjects from their background. < br / > - decreased the effective iso of high speed film ( i.e . : above iso400 ) and allow it to be used outdoors in blight situations. < br / > - allows cine and video cameras ( which have fixed shutter speeds ) to film subjects such as snow , sand or other bright scenes which would normally cause over-exposure.ally with fast films , to record movement in subjects such as waterfalls , clouds , cars , seas etc. < br / > - decreases depth of field by allowing wider apertures to be used , which helps separate subjects from their background. < br / > - decreased the effective iso of high speed film ( i.e . : above iso400 ) and allow it to be used outdoors in blight situations. < br / > - allows cine and video cameras ( which have fixed shutter speeds ) to film subjects such as snow , sand or other bright scenes which would normally cause over-exposure .
__label__positive__ exactly as described . i was hesitant to get four section legs ( as opposed to 3 ) but i am impressed by the stability with a 65mm spitting scope on top .
__label__positive__ kenneth gave me great customer service and was helpful until i got my system all setup thank you !
__label__positive__ just the right size for my fujinon xf 55-200mm lens .
__label__positive__ i have been using canon s-series cameras for many years , including the s-30 , s90 , and now s-120 . love this s-120 because of all the manual features it offers along with great automatic/program modes . it take fabulous photos in automatic but i can flip it to manual modes and get really creative without carrying my big eos t3i . i also put this in the canon waterproof dive case and take it scuba diving . great compact size that produces amazing photos !
__label__neutral__ fairly easy to set up however , i can not seem to view this camera via any app other than the one suggested . i will update this review after further attempts. < br / > < br / > update ( 1/21/16 ) - apparently this camera , as well as most of the ip cameras available are now made with only peer-to-peer ( p2p ) technology . i do not like p2p at all as i was more flexibility as to how i view all of my cameras . i have to use one app/computer software to view my dvr and other network cameras and another app/computer software to view this one .
__label__positive__ i 'm a pretty serious photographer and i own a lot of cameras . this is the second of these cameras i 've bought . this one was a gift for my husband . these are the finest cameras in this size range , and absolutely the only game in town for interchangeable lens system cameras in the extremely compact category . the quality of the photographs is remarkable . it wo n't replace your big dslr or even your bigger mirrorless rig , but i can carry it and three extra lenses in my tote and get great pictures . it weighs less than my compact point & shoot . i really love it and i take it with me literally everywhere .
__label__negative__ ****update****** . after 10 months of very light use , this flash is completely worthless . i ca n't shoot more than a few shots , if that , before it says it 's overheating and goes into a cool-down mode , rendering it unreliable at best and most of the times unusable . i now regret the gamble i made buying this flash . should have bought the canon version ! do n't waste your time and money on this one .
__label__positive__ worked as advertised . the european adapter is a nice plus .
__label__positive__ excellent !
__label__positive__ bought this to mount my canon ef 50mm to new samsung nx300 , and works like a charm . manual focus only , like other reviewers mentioned . i did n't get any tightness , either putting the lens with the mount , or the mount to the camera body . everything worked smoothly and is great . love that i can get more use out of my 50mm !
__label__positive__ excellent product - something i 've been looking for for years ! < br / > < br / > i heard about this product about a year ago ... and patiently waited for it to be available . we bought the full camcorder bundle , as i did n't want to have to keep swapping tripod and video camera with other things we do . i have the bundle all packed up & ready to take with me to the barn as a moment 's notice . i have been using my soloshot2 since early-april. < br / > < br / > the product has worked as advertised and i have had no issues . i have done 1 firmware update so far and do my best to remember to keep it fully charged & ready to go . it 's take a few tries to get it set exactly the way i want for riding , but every use still gave me great video feedback & now i can be set up in just minutes . the longest piece is waiting the 8min to have the tag warmup , but i start that now when i 'm tacking up - so it 's really no bother at all. < br / > < br / > i have enjoyed sharing my videos and , more importantly , been able to improve in my riding by being able to record my lessons & then watch at home . also , it is so wonderful to no longer be dependant on getting my husband or a friend to give up time to stand & video me . plus , there is no & # 34 ; human error & # 34 ; in someone missing a jump because they got distracted , looking the wrong direction , or doing crazy in/out zooming ( & # 62 ; puke & # 60 ; ) . the video pans & zooms smoothly and precisely. < br / > < br / > i have used my soloshot2 in the following environments : < br / > * huge outdoor jumping arena < br / > * small outdoor arena < br / > * cross-country schooling ( video carrying through both open field & forested areas ) < br / > * covered outdoor arena ( this is working for me ... i warm up the tag outside , set the base/camera outside , but wear the tag while riding under the cover ; however this is not an & # 34 ; indoor & # 34 ; /fully-enclosed arena ) < br / > * backyard ( had fun filming my kiddo running around ) < br / > < br / > also , soloshot customer service is great ! - quick to respond , nice updates , happy to help. < br / > < br / > totally worth it . love it . thank you , soloshot !
__label__positive__ great price works well
__label__positive__ great little device that simplifies password hassels , well made and fantastic quality
__label__positive__ i bought this for my daughter 's 16th birthday and she loves it . it is a great starter camera for the serious young photographer , or anyone starting out for that matter . all the items in this particular package are of good quality , and the canon products are excellent .
__label__positive__ works great !
__label__positive__ battery is in new condition with good outdate .
__label__positive__ it 's an excellent product that beyond i expect .
__label__positive__ amazing product . works great . definitely recommend it .
__label__positive__ perfect
__label__positive__ as expected and on time .
__label__positive__ very good lens . wide angle . at these focal lengths it distorts , but that is what you want . great for landscapes . my daughter in law even shot bicycle races . very interesting pictures where distortion adds drama to the image. < br / > i am very happy with this lens . very well made . sony has e-mount lenses that are chipper . this one is more expensive but it is worth every penny .
__label__positive__ works well . i love the network wi-fi feature to work with my ipad . manual is laborious ... it goes on and on and on .
__label__positive__ the sensitivity for the motion sensor is impossible to get just right . it either captures the light changing or doesnt capture movement at all . still a pretty good product
__label__positive__ bought it as a gift , hope they like it .
__label__positive__ works well , had for a while and still working well . nights a little blurry but still good . i will try to put a photo or two on here of the night vision . in the next couple days . : - )
__label__positive__ excellent product
__label__positive__ these lithium batteries were great in my new sony camera . i love that the included charged has both a 120 volt and a car charger . everything works great .
__label__positive__ charged and powered my camera as expected . good product .
__label__positive__ fantastic value . i 've waited long enough for nikon to produce a micro lens for the nikon 1 , these do the job . i used them with my 70-300cx lens and the detail of the shots is phenomenal . af is fast with these . i spent a few months reading reviews in the various photo forums about nikon 1 series tubes , these came out on top because of their metal construction .
__label__positive__ does look a little big for a newborn but will make great photos anyway . nice price too
__label__positive__ i feel like i stole this item for what i paid . it works perfectly !
__label__neutral__ if your looking for a wireless shutter realease that wo n't break the bank , go for it . sometimes it did not respond and i had to reconnect several times ( i have a nikon d600 ) . after it started working , it stayed working flawlessly until the job was finished .
__label__positive__ could n't be happier ! what a vendor !
__label__negative__ bad quality product !
__label__positive__ updated on august 17th , 2015 : < br / > < br / > i was contacted by a representative for the company and was advised to lower the screen resolution on my computer and that should solve the problem . i did as advised and sure enough the clarity did get noticeably better . now you will have to adjust your computer screen accordingly , but that did end up solving the primary issue that i had with this projector , so i have now updated this review to 3.5 stars ( even though i put 4 stars because you ca n't go half a star ) from the original 2 star rating that i had initially given it. < br / > < br / > original review as posted : < br / > < br / > okay , like i stated in the title of this review , you definitely get what you pay for , and that could n't be more true about this mini projector . it is n't a bad little projector , but do n't expect it to act like one that cost a couple of hundred dollars , because it wo n't . i have a bigger projector and thought that this would be an interesting projector to try out and see how it compared to my bigger yet older one . well , there really is n't that much to compare . in order for this projector to work at its best , you need to make sure that you are pretty much in a light free void of complete darkness in order to have this projector work to any acceptable degree with a slide presentation of any kind . now i did n't think it was totally horrible , but i could see where there could quite possibly be a definite argument for such. < br / > < br / > i could see this being used primarily as an emergency back-up type of projector , but if you are looking for one to use on a regular basis under normal conditions , i would definitely spend a bit more money and look for another projector of a bit higher quality. < br / > < br / > shawn kovacich < br / > author and creator of numerous books and dvd 's .
__label__positive__ excellent
__label__positive__ works like a camera lens should 😏
__label__negative__ worked great for a while but after a few uses a ball connected to the base broke . i still try to use it with only 2 legs but the product should n't have broke . i did not bend in any bad direction . since the ball was stuck instead of rotating , the ball just snapped out of place . i am going to try super gluing . product is not worth the money because of its lack of strength .
__label__positive__ it really one of the fantastic telescopes ever owned . i used it around 5 times before i write this review . first time , i needed to watch some youtube videos to understand how to calibrate it . i faced some problems to coordinate it using auto two stars method at the city but using three bright stars method was really helpful . now , i can calibrate it within less than 3 minutes ! ! i bought the pads to reduce valibration , power tank , adapter and celestron eyepieces and filters set all for around 270 $ . i watched the moon , saturn and jupiter and their moons , venus and stars .
__label__positive__ nice kit and well built except for the & # 34 ; selfy stick & # 34 ; .
__label__positive__ i love it . my only concern is i think the drone is used ! i 've watch several videos on unpacking these things and the one i received is diffidently a used drone . besides that it appears to work fine . i do have several website issues but that 's something i need to work out with dji as you can see the drone is very dirty and the stickers are already on it and the 4 propeller stickers/guards were all missing
__label__positive__ it works great . add your own casing/mounting , and it works with any software that supports standard system webcams on any modern os ( which support uvc usb webcams ) . i 've used it with os x , ubuntu linux , and a chromebook . it is indeed quite wide angle ; colors are maybe a bit yellow ish .
__label__negative__ loved the design and concept , but i ca n't focus on the viewing screen , with or without glasses . it needs to come back another 1/4 to 1/2 inch to focus properly . very disappointed . contacted neewer customer service with photos of focusing anomalies , < br / > their response < br / > & # 34 ; i checked and found there is no problem with it , because it should work with camera , and there is no need to come back ... .. & # 34 ; < br / > best regards , < br / > neewer support team & # 34 ; < br / > < br / > my response : < br / > & # 34 ; well it doesn ’ t work with the camera . i know it should ! but it doesn ’ t ! < br / > the focus is off . and requires a corrective lens to focus properly. < br / > i will leave an appropriate note on social media. < br / > < br / > michael hoskins & # 34 ;
__label__positive__ i like it
__label__positive__ much smaller than i expected but great quality .
__label__positive__ works well and a great price .
__label__positive__ i just love it ! ! !
__label__positive__ beautifully performing fast glass . never been disappointed yet .
__label__positive__ it was what i expected
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ this plate . is almost identical to the original . i would have given it a perfect but because its missing the housing to attach a screw in neck strap like the original , i give it 3 stars . he guys , it would be nice to have that feature . i sometimes like to run and gun from the tripod .
__label__neutral__ you can tell that it is not as nice as the real stuff but it still gets the job done for way less. < br / > the plastic is a bit more easy to break than the real deal , i 've already broke 2 clips , but it all works well. < br / > i will probably continue to purchase from this seller again .
__label__positive__ easy to use , glad to have it while being on our tropical trip ( boating , fishing , snorkeling ) !
__label__positive__ good but not great binoculars . i use these for hunting and in good light , they work great . for early morning or late day/late evening hunts with low light conditions , they are not the best .
__label__neutral__ the idea for this product is great , but the rotating peg comes off its base pretty easily .
__label__positive__ best investment from amazon yet , what a great deal
__label__positive__ the lens cap and body cap fit my sony a6000 perfectly
__label__positive__ very nice , great price !
__label__neutral__ the focus length on this camera is really really short , in other words , you can only see a sharp image a few inches in front of the camera . the camera light 's brightness must be turn down otherwise , all you see a blinding white light . the light adjustment is on the usb plug that goes into the laptop . i think this camera would be more helpful and useful if it did not to restrict the focus like that ... it is like walking through a blacken-out tunnel with a cheap tiny flashlight operating on a used-up general use battery . it does n't give you much warning if you suddenly happened upon the creature from the black lagoon nose to nose .
__label__positive__ great . very easy setup
__label__positive__ excellent
__label__neutral__ wobbly after a few uses , i would n't recommend any camera that is over 1.5lbs
__label__positive__ great tripod ! ! i highly recommend it ! !
__label__positive__ leo was very helpful and friendly ! ! ask for leo if you need help ever ! !
__label__negative__ this item broke within 10 minutes of me wearing it . i am very dissatisfied with this product . my camera is now sunk to the bottom of the ocean floor due to their faulty product .
__label__positive__ amazing
__label__positive__ thanks just what i needed
__label__positive__ everything was exactly as advertised and well packaged . my son loves the camera . great value package ! ! !
__label__negative__ i got to use it once and it completely stopped working . needless to say , i 'm a bit pissed about that .
__label__positive__ shot one roll and immediately had it developed . this film is wonderful ! ca n't wait to use the rest .
__label__negative__ the plastic thread is horrible , i tried it on my different lenses and i ca n't get it to work properly . you ca n't really tighten it up as the plastic wo n't allow it . just a waste of money !
__label__positive__ you know , you should probably just buy these and then finish reading the reviews , on the off chance that you 're near the deadline for shipping . why ? because you want these asap. < br / > < br / > here 's why : < br / > < br / > ( 1 ) they 're a perfect size for most uses - big enough for glasses , screens , phone displays , watches ... anything . not too big , not too small . awesome all around size. < br / > < br / > ( 2 ) they work *beautifully* . obviously , that 's the most important requirement , and these deliver in spades . they clean well , they wash up nicely for reuse , and they work use after use after use eve when not washed in between. < br / > < br / > ( 3 ) they are individually packaged . this is fantastic - buy a bunch , toss some into glove boxes , suitcases , briefcases , purses , backpacks ... you 'll have a fresh , clean , unused microfiber cloth when you need it , and the price per cloth is crazy low , so there 's no issue with getting extras. < br / > < br / > ( 4 ) they are thin enough to keep one in all your laptops - keep one on the keys , and it 's always there to clean your screen . you can buy sizes that are better for this purpose , but these do the trick and are very inexpensive. < br / > < br / > get whatever color ( s ) you like . you will not regret this purchase , and odds are good that you 'll buy them again . especially if , like me , you 're a nice guy ( or gal ) and give them to friends in need. < br / > < br / > note : i bought a [ [ asin : b01042pwtc different package of these same cloths ] ] , but the review applies these , as they 're the same microfiber cloths .
__label__positive__ great camera with easy set up !
__label__positive__ ok it works
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ great price , so excited that it actually works for my camera , charges pretty quickly .
__label__positive__ so far works great for me
__label__positive__ this thing is fantastic ! i 'm not going to say it 's better than the actual gopro version , but it 's at the very least , equivalent . and the price is amazing . there 's really nothing else to say .
__label__positive__ easy to install and use for magnifying the surface of objects . good magnification . excellent value for the price .
__label__positive__ good lens for shooting moon .
__label__positive__ i can only tell you this : being one who has been in constant thirst for photography since the early 70 's , and a professional for many years , this is truly a wonderful find ! there is only a few things you need to know , and they are : & # 34 ; precision ... precision ... .precision & # 34 ; ! that 's all you need to know ! ! thanks , shooter boone .
__label__positive__ shiped ahead of time .awsome
__label__positive__ great gift for my sport enthusiast cousin . small and light weight enough to put in the bag and carry around .
__label__neutral__ works ok , great power , but it overheats too quickly
__label__negative__ i just got the system . setup instructions are very confusing . a tiny magnet is required to pair the cameras to the receiver . they do n't tell you where the magnets are but after careful inspection , i found the micro magnets stuck to the bottom of the mounting brackets . i have set up just one cam so far and it works . i will.update this review when and if i can understand the manual . wow ... so confusing. < br / > < br / > revision to my review . i 've now had plenty of time to test this product and i do n't like giving bad reviews unless necessary but there are issues with this product . first of all , the mounting hardware is very weak . the hardware that mounts the camera to the mount.will snap off with minimal amount of hand tightening . as far as the transmission range from camera to receiver is concerned , they advertise 100 meters which i translate to approximately 300 feet is completely not true . all 4 of my cameras lose signal at less than 20 feet , far less than the 300 feet as advertised . this system is pretty much useless to me as i need to be standing within 20 feet of the cameras for the receiver to pick up the signal . also when looking at the pics of the receiver , everything is in living color . in actuality everything looks black and white . the color is not there except for trees . the green leaves are purple . the video is not smooth nor is the audio . sorry guys but if you 're looking for an easy to set up and well working security system , this is not it ! ! ! < br / > < br / > one more addition to this review. < br / > this unit seems to run off the battery only . the charger can not keep up with the battery consumption so this unit is unable to run 24/7 . i 've tried to run it all.day and night but it keeps shutting off even when plugged into the wall . if you need a security system that records 24/7 , this will not work . every night i turn it on to record outside.moving objects and every morning the entire system has shut down and the battery is dead even when plugged in . this system reminds me.of old 1970s technology that is experimental and does not work well .
__label__positive__ i purchased this ball head pretty much based on the glowing review that was already posted . the head arrived quickly and was packaged well . there 's not much to say that has n't already been said by the previous reviewers and they were spot on in their assessment . suffice it to say , this is great head for the price and i 'm sure glad i did n't settle for the $ 25 cheapie that i was originally looking at !
__label__negative__ could use improvement . relies on manual entry by the operator way too much ( which means it has poor software ) . comes with an alarm clock , but no way to enable the alarm if the camera senses motion . only allows for five recording times to be pre-programmed . you can not program a recording schedule . for a 4-camera system , you would have to program it everyday to record during a time-slot at night . also , there is no way to enable motion detection recording during certain time slots . you would have to enable it every night manually . tablet batteries die very quickly . if you need a system just to see who is at the door or monitoring your dogs in your backyard , this probably would be a great system ; but for overall security , this system is lacking . remote viewing software buggy , and unreliable .
__label__positive__ great price and old favorite brand . vivitar . i get terrific color saturation with the cpl and use it with a lens adapter ring on my fujifilm < br / > camera . the uv filter protects the lens when the camera is in the bag . very happy with this buy !
__label__positive__ this small guide is very handy to have . these cameras have so many knobs on them that it takes a long while to get to know all of them and what they do for you . these small guides really help out on finding out what your new camera can do !
__label__positive__ just exactly what i need to keep my glasses clean . i can keep a cloth in several places so i am never without one . also good for cleaning screen of tablet . great value , good product and service .
__label__positive__ my cell-phone was n't holding a charge so i was pleased to find this replacement battery on amazon.com . i ca n't believe the price ! i ordered three and charged them as soon as i received them . they hold a charge a long time and work fine . i have a lg370 cell-phone and am resisting getting a & # 34 ; smart & # 34 ; phone . i 'm a senior citizen and 'old-school ' , so i want to try to hold onto my very functional phone which serves my purpose . thanks , amazon for making this possible !
__label__negative__ my experience with this product is negative . it did not connect properly to communicate with my camera/lens . the description in the sales literature said it would work with nikon d5100 , etc. , and it did not work with mine . i am returning it today .
__label__positive__ the fact that i could 2 of these , plus stands and triggers for the price of one equivalent canon flash is awesome . pretty much as bright and quick . you can get around a 1/2000th second flash duration on 1/4 power so it is amazing for action sports !
__label__positive__ top quality , attached perfectly to the fx-3 and holds macro ringlight and adapters with ease .
__label__positive__ no leaks !
__label__positive__ very nice~ !
__label__positive__ bought 4 for a gopro 1 , 3+ , 4 , 4 . case is great just wish height was 1 & # 34 ; higher , width & length are good but with one more inch higher easier to put more stuff in it such as a dual battery charger for gp4s and a float pro to keep camera afloat since all bought for snorkeling bahamas 2015 .
__label__positive__ of course the day after i ordered this i found the original one , but i did keep this one . i tried it out and it did work and saving it as back up for when i lose the one that came with my fuji camera .
__label__positive__ my first drone , far exceeds my expectations . already making movie quality videos .
__label__positive__ for the price , it is fantastic.not as thickly padded as the expensive ones , but serves it 's purpose .
__label__negative__ this said it would fit my camera and it was n't even close . now i do n't have time before my trip to find something else that probably would have worked .
__label__positive__ this was easy to fit in a matter of seconds . there are no elaborate fixings , just an elastic-type band which is built in. < br / > < br / > it certainly diffused the light without blocking it off completely . i found that by using this , i was getting less red-eye on my photos and therefore they did n't need touching up , so saved me time .
__label__positive__ great camera we love it !
__label__positive__ i needed extra camera batteries for an extended trip away from power sources and stk filled the bill nicely . these are 100 % compatible with my two canon powershot elph cameras and are priced better than most . delivery was fast via usps envelope ( no wasted packaging ) and stk followed up via email to make sure my order arrived on time .
__label__positive__ amazing lens ! it has a lot of plastic construction but it still feels well built and takes great sharp photos with bokeh. < br / > < br / > see more of my photos with this lens on my instagram @ _chris_crowell_
__label__positive__ first off have a camera is not uncool mobile phones are still playing catch up , i have purchase this camera for someone and yes ! this person really knows how to put a camera to work.anyway so taking high quality photos has never been so great and colorful in the day and the night , it has a lot of feature that would keep your causal photographer busy , the zoom and manual focus is wonderful . i 'm not a camera geek , so i wo n't be able to tell you advance stuff like specs but i can tell when i 'm holding a great piece of hardware < br / > < br / > con : the only thing my sister complains about is that some of the fun apps are not compatible ( it is possible to install them to the camera but it does n't work properly ) or not available . for this model . sad : ( & # 34 ; it kind of a girl thing but taking high res pics is good enough for me & # 34 ;
__label__negative__ you get what you pay for . i was looking for a cheap stand-in before purchasing a micro-nikkor , but this lens attachment just did n't live up to expectation . the sharpness is mediocre at best ( and who wants to shoot macro that 's not perfectly sharp ? ! ! ) and seems to fall off radically around the edges . i 'll just suck it up and buy the micro-nikkor and consider this a lesson learned .
__label__negative__ it is complete junk it dont work at all i wouldnt even give it 1star but i had to.dont buy this
__label__positive__ looks good but i have not tested it out yet . thank you .
__label__positive__ still use it
__label__positive__ great seller - delivered as promised !
__label__positive__ this is a great set of lens protectors and the folding storage case fits in my camera backpack .
__label__positive__ great case for the nikon d3300 . this travel case came in a bundle we purchased including case ( this one ) , 16gb memory card , and nikon d3300 for the same price as the nikon d3300 traditionally .
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ so far , so good . very bright .
__label__positive__ this is a great camera for the price . it provides a good quality image and helpful features . the app is easy to use and available for my windows 8 computer and android phone . however , as far as i could tell it is not available for the ipad and i had a very difficult time with the initial set up . i tried live chat on the foscam website . the technician was very slow and not helpful . i called and received a technician named terry morgan he was very helpful and was able to set everything up remotely . since then i have had no issues . if you run into any difficulties with set up i would not hesitate to call . its a great product and easy to adjust to view a variety of angles .
__label__negative__ did n't come with the 8gb card and had to send back .
__label__positive__ can you use the mini usb to 3.5mm adopter to connect a mic on it ? so i can plug the camera on my motorcycle helmet , and do motovlog
__label__positive__ a great case at a fair price . study , lightweight , with excellent fit and finish . sure , a pelican case ( at twice the price ) would work too , but i do n't need something to stand up to a direct nuclear strike , just some protection from the average ( and above average ) bump and drop accidents that typically occur . i hope smatree branches out and starts making similar cases in other sizes , as well . there 's a market out there for this !
__label__negative__ a narrow field of view you feel like looking at a hole in the door
__label__positive__ ok
__label__positive__ really a great beginners drone . lots of fun , wish the batteries last longer
__label__positive__ just a little pricey for what you get , but really sweet . i loved the small pictures and bought frames for them to use in a little mini-display .
__label__negative__ the leds are grossly underpowered . it wont even light up an area 10 feet away . i 'm sorry i bought it . used to sell for over a hundred dollars ? baloney !
__label__negative__ it does not hold a charge ... .disappointed for the price paid .
__label__positive__ nice color
__label__neutral__ i like that i received this with a discount coupon , my grandson is thrill . i did n't really understand what this did initially when he asked for one but the pictures he took were very professional looking. < br / > no tools need , you do n't have to screw on anything to your phone . i 'm going to try this out over the weekend to see if i can make my dog adoption pictures and videos a little more interesting. < br / > ***** < br / > i tried it on my lg stylo and i did n't get nearly the good results i thought my grandson had with his iphone 6 plus . my images came out blurry . when looking at his images on the phone , they looked pretty sharp but after emailing the files to my computer , you can see the quality is not great .
__label__positive__ my first coolpix lasted for seven years before its battery died , so i got a new battery as well as a replacement and now i have two good cameras. < br / > < br / > i use it mostly for taking photos of landscapes and scenery during hikes and trail runs . it 's small and compact , and the picture quality i 'm getting is fantastic . the zoom is tremendous , and i get crisp non-blurry shots even at 10x when it 's in my hands . and it fits onto my gorillapod when i need to get myself in the shot as well. < br / > < br / > i have n't tested it much indoors , or in low-light conditions .
__label__positive__ once i purchased the bose ear pad replacements from amazon , and found that they are as good as all the reviewers stated , i ordered the gopro case directly from the headcase audio company . it is very strange that the camera does n't come with a case - this solves that problem in an elegant fashion . yeah , the gopro camera is tough and able to put up with a lot ( just bought the dog harness - he does n't understand the concept of & # 34 ; be careful with the camera & # 34 ; ) , however , it is very convenient to have a place to put all of the accessories and camera , so that i know that it is all together and ready for the next time it will be used . highly recommend this product ! btw - if you deal with the company directly , you 'll be amazed at their outstanding customer service - you rarely find this attention from most vendors - it was refreshing , surprising , and very much appreciated !
__label__positive__ great camera
__label__positive__ very effective and simple to use
__label__positive__ robust and durable .
__label__positive__ working with no problems
__label__positive__ does what nikon said it would it would do .
__label__positive__ hey ... i 'm not sure about the other reviews but all the accessories are super good quality , i compared to a friend 's go pro accessory kit and we agreed it was the same level of quality as his set . all parts attach and detach properly . the battery works great and has the same battery life as the battery that comes with the camera.the dual usb battery charger works great as well . i tried the head strap and the waterproof casi for a bicycle ride to the gym on a rainy day and it worked great , stable and the camera did n't come loose even on the super bumpy countryside road . one thing though : the metal buttons on the waterproof casing are scratchy , to fix this i attached small pieces of synthetic leather to the inside part of the buttons and it does not scratch my buttons . i have not tried to submerge the case yet but will try later next week , however even if this case is not good i 'm happy with the quality of the rest : ) . the little bag is super awesome .
__label__neutral__ set up was easy but i can not figure out how to record . it states that i need a password and to use default but that does n't work . great for viewing who is outside at the moment either from screen or app on your phone . the cameras do show great pictures both during day and night .
__label__positive__ very good flash for the price . it is not capable of being off camera unless you have a remote trigger . the yongnuo tx is great because it also allows you to control the settings of the flash while off camera .
__label__neutral__ price is good ... i guess material is ok for the price . it is cheap !
__label__positive__ high quality
__label__positive__ great one day shipping , product works flawlessly with the sony a6000 . all buttons work as suppose to .
__label__negative__ i am very happy to get the disposable camera , because i ca n't find them in a store anymore ... irene
__label__positive__ does the job . takes quick photos and prints them out . so glad i have this camera . : )
__label__positive__ great lens for portraits . canon always a great product .
__label__positive__ went right together with no cutting . 2 thumbs up
__label__negative__ many issues with this refurbished gopro . i had to return and get a 'new ' gopro. < br / > < br / > some of the issues : < br / > camera would freeze . this would happen without it overheating and with a gopro certified micro sd card. < br / > screen would turn on with a purple hue on the entire screen , and at times just part of the screen. < br / > camera would not fully charge the battery ( gopro battery which came with camera ) . it would stop charging as if the battery were fully charged , but battery would be 2/3s or 1/3 charged .
__label__positive__ nice to be able to use my old lens again .
__label__positive__ the drone was as expected , easy to fly , hoping that dji will be able to send updates that will allow us to program routes
__label__positive__ scary at first - lot 's of weird reviews and problems . well , no problem . 5 minutes after the box was opened , i was recording video through my iphone . very cool . pans and elevates . takes a large microsd card to record on . uses lan cord to setup , then wireless . 2 way audio , picture snapshots of video , motion detection , email notifications with video and pictures , just on and on. < br / > < br / > picture quality ( with night vision ) is good . 1280 resolution , various frame rates , dial on lens to fine tune focus . i am sure a more expensive unit might provide a better picture , but this suits most everyones purpose . a steal at ~ $ 45.00 , free same day shipping too. < br / > < br / > long term use and durability is still a question , but i think if you care for it like any other electronic thing , it should last a long time . buy a few of them to use around the house .
__label__positive__ great , perfect for keeping my glasses and camera lens clean
__label__positive__ great product
__label__negative__ this battery lasted 2 years , and then failed . worse yet , both sides split .
__label__positive__ extremely easy to install these wireless cameras . each camera had an antenna and only required an electrical outlet to operate . a matching ( small ) receiver had dual antennas to receive the signals of both cameras . they plugged into my existing & # 34 ; night owl & # 34 ; dvr and worked instantly . you do not have to be a techy to install these wireless cameras . i spent less than 60 minutes installing both . day vision is excellent and in full color . night vision is good for about 50 feet or so . not sure what distance they are rated for but probably would be less effective in ranges beyond that stated . cost was very competitive .
__label__positive__ as expected
__label__positive__ love it , love it , just a great idea.great product and the service from the vendor was prompt
__label__positive__ had for 3 months now . works great ! very little lag , good quality . motion detection is a little jumpy and seems to go off at just shifts in the lighting in the room -- not sure if it works great as an alerting system . and the interface on ios , though very capable , is a little strange . not as clean as i 'd like . but both minor gripes . i happily give it 5 stars -- it 's a perfect little monitor for us to check on our pets .
__label__positive__ these adapters are just what i needed , since not all of the gopro mounts are designed for use with the quick release buckle . with this adapter , you can covert any gopro mount into a quick release .
__label__positive__ one battery has lasted for a few months already in my dog 's bark collar , with no sign of slowing down yet
__label__positive__ it 's a great lens.. thanks
__label__negative__ not at all what i wanted . i needed a 460 or 470 . waiting on seller to respond to my return request .
__label__positive__ so cute
__label__positive__ magnetic feet are a great feature
__label__positive__ this is the best camera ever . it zooms in better than the more expensive cameras .
__label__positive__ darn someone stole it ... .no wonder ... a great camera
__label__positive__ got this for my birthday from my wife to upgrade the dinky factory bag that came with my camera bundle . i really like the amount of room this pack has and easy access for all of your go to accessories .
__label__positive__ i was looking for a wifi camera that would be able to rotate & zoom . i am able to look over the kitchen , dinning room , & family room all from 1 camera . now i 'm able to check the house if the home alarm is triggered and see if anyone is actually in my house . also great to monitor your pets with . the fact that you can hear & speak to people through the camera is a nice feature . the motion alerts is kind of buggy at times . it 's either way too sensitive or nothing at all . ca n't really complain too much , the camera is a great buy for the price .
__label__positive__ arrived quickly . decent for the price .
__label__positive__ just returned from rome and greece . this little camera takes amazing pictures with little work on my part , but it does help to understand the setting options before a trip : ) what i was most impressed with is how great my pictures turned out in museums and chapels where flashes were not allowed . it also compensates when taking pictures that are back-light . if you are interested , it has a two and ten second delay for & # 34 ; selfies & # 34 ; which are n't up in your face . there have been a couple of comments about the camera being made cheaply . i too was surprised by the delicate plastic parts , but just the same , this is the best point and shoot camera i have owned , and it has more capabilities that i have n't had time to explore . again , i was very pleased with pictures taken without a flash or in less that optimal lighting situations .
__label__negative__ i , unfortunately , had a bad experience with this item : < br / > < br / > 1 ) installed software update < br / > 2 ) shut down the camera < br / > 3 ) camera started to over heat < br / > 4 ) opened the case to access the camera and removed the battery < br / > 5 ) noticed that the top right corner had cracked
__label__positive__ this fits great on the e-m10 and definitely helps with holding this with one hand . it appears to be made mostly of metal and it gives the camera a little more weight and size ( obviously ) but i will take the added maneuverability any day !
__label__neutral__ hard to find additional quick release plate mounts : ( < br / > all the plate mounts that do fit come from overseas and takes mount or more to arrive
__label__positive__ great replacement for the camera battery .
__label__positive__ excellent product just as advertised . it is connected to my samsung smart cam hd pro cameras using rtsp. < br / > the unit is small and does not have a fan which is a big plus . the hard drive mounting holes are made for a 3.5 & # 34 ; drive but i was reluctant to install the large drive due to potential heat problems . i tried to connect my 250gb pny ssd which it did not recognize so i ended up installing a 1tb 2.5 & # 34 ; drive with 2.5 & # 34 ; to 3.5 & # 34 ; mounting bracket which works perfect. < br / > best part of the product is that you can view and control the cameras via a straight web browser both on a mac and pc without any plugins except for a flash player. < br / > so far i am very happy with the product since it does exactly what i need it for .
__label__neutral__ warning : manual lens ( not just manual focus ! ) if you are a newbie that relies on auto-focus , auto-aperture , auto-everything else , you will need to learn how to use a manual lens . the glass is pretty clear and some good pics are possible , but , it is up to you ( not the lens or camera ) to learn how to use it properly . do some research on how to use a manual lens !
__label__positive__ love this ! i wish i 'd had it sooner ! what a peace of mind to keep an eye on my dementia mom !
__label__neutral__ this is a good camera . takes good stills and can video record . but for the same money i like the canon sl1 better . it 's small and have auto focus in video where the t3i does not making it not very users friendly for videos .
__label__positive__ perfect !
__label__negative__ cam worked great for about 10 months then all of the sudden it stopped recording video , audio still works but nothing else . contacted seller and they refused to replace the cam . they told me i could contact the manufacturers in china if i wanted but they were n't going to help . waste of $ 125 bucks . dont buy from seller ... ... .
__label__positive__ nice
__label__positive__ very good unit for prosumer photographer .
__label__negative__ the legs are extremely thin and unstable .
__label__negative__ i carry a track phone that does not take good pictures and wanted a small light cheap camera to carry in my purse . the pictures are grainy unless you have really good light and then when in sunlight its a pretty soft picture anyway . inside shots are poor even with flash . people have to be absolutely still or they blur . focusing is hit and miss i never know what the camera will think is important to focus on . i point at a person 4 feet away it will focus on the wall 10 feet away type of thing . i know it is a cheap camera , but i was hoping it would be half decent -- i was looking for half -- because it fit my need for being small and light . it is going back .
__label__positive__ very nice , exactly what i was looking for , very quick shipping
__label__positive__ lots of fun ways to use gopro
__label__positive__ i use this to record for youtube . and for this price the quality is very high . i 'm pleased .
__label__negative__ purchased this item with the expectation that it would include a power source ( it does n't ) and would be a complete video camera able to be plugged in and used without much trouble ( it 's not ) . < br / > < br / > this item is only a camera body , if you need vital pieces like a lens and or a power source , buy elsewhere .
__label__positive__ wow how freaking awesome ! i ordered and a day later it came to my front door . the batteries work and hold a great charge and the charger sits on my desk taking no room . very happy and for the price i might just buy another set .
__label__negative__ do not buy ! i have 3 of these systems and on every system 2 cameras on each system went bad . if you know what is good fo you do n't buy this junk . do n't buy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ work great and a good price .
__label__positive__ great product . its finish is of very high quality . it does not get in the picture corners when taking 4:3 stills . definitely improves video and stills quality in moderate to strong sunlight . fits very snugly . it feels a bit heavy on the gimbal at first but the gimbal operates normally and has no problem handling the extra weight of this filter .
__label__positive__ we love it ! ! !
__label__positive__ batteries fit perfectly into charger and camera . they do n't hold a charge for as long as the original batteries , but they are great as back ups .
__label__positive__ the fit and finish is very good . slips perfectly over the x100s body without any rub or friction points . the dimensions also seem consistent with acra plates / mounts . my only minor nit is that the screw to tighten on the tripod mount requires a screwdriver as opposed to having a flip-out thumb screw on some other models .
__label__negative__ neat idea , cheap plastic . it is currently held together with zip ties . the plastic is very brittle and weak around the rivets that attach it to the strap . this means you could lose your camera ! i literally zip tied the thing together to ensure i do n't lose my camera by breaking off . swivel lock comes loose by any bump , which means your camera angle is lost . 1 star because the wrist strap part is actually nice .
__label__positive__ absolutely love this camera ! also have a dlink but this one blows it away . i use it in my house to keep an eye on my dog . she recently had surgery so i want to make sure she 's okay during the day while i 'm at work . i can pan around the room to find her . i can listen in to see if she 's barking and i can also talk to her through the microphone . it 's absolutely amazing . i 'm thinking of buying another one as well . i 've also recommended it to friends looking for security cameras for inside the house. < br / > it was easy to setup . probably took less than 10 minutes . i spent way more time trying to figure out where to put it . you can move to another location easily ; just unplug and plug back in at the new location . so easy .
__label__positive__ old school ! feels like i am back in school < br / > thank you !
__label__negative__ submerged in the sink under 5 inches of water and it does not turn on anymore and makes short beeps . the battery compartment is all dry , however i could see air bubbles coming up from top of the camera once submerged . i have attached couple of pictures showing water droplets inside the flash and led windows . for what its worth i have a blue one . contacted panasonic customer service and they only offered repair only ! ! the rep suggested to contact seller for replacement .
__label__positive__ this was very easy to set up with the wink hub using the included instructions . i have no complaints as the sensors work perfectly . the ir sensor has some brains to it so waiving your hand in front of it is not going to result in constant motion alerts transmitted to your wink hub , thus draining the sensor battery . instead , the sensor alerts on the first motion and does not alert again until all motion has stopped for several minutes . after motion has stopped for several minutes it sends a & # 34 ; motion stopped & # 34 ; alert. < br / > < br / > this behavior is vastly more useful than the battery draining dumb ir sensor behavior that another reviewer was expecting . the sensor is n't broken guy , its just smart .
__label__positive__ excellent lights with great color . plenty of power as described and built very well . i really like how they are low power consumption for the light they emit at constant power , which did n't blow a fuse or trip the breakers in a standard 120v outlet . these are excellent hot lights for the price and the dimming feature is a plus . i was concerned about ballast noise but it was very subtle and consistent like very soft white noise , nothing to worry about . the size of the ballast is fairly big but i had no problem with them or maneuvering them around for a shoot . highly recommended for this price and power output !
__label__positive__ i needed something compact for spare lenses . these are perfect . i love the cinch cord with hooks so i can clip them to other items or my bag . the padding offers extra cushion to protect the lens . great value .
__label__positive__ excellent product ... ..very roomy .
__label__positive__ after reading all the reviews , i elected to buy this lcd cover ( i 'm too clumsy not to scratch things ) . easiest application ever , perfect fit - looks like part of the camera . does n't obscure screen at all . very happy with purchase !
__label__positive__ great value , good quality kit , seems solid .
__label__negative__ after spending several hours trying to make it work wifi , i give up . i tried mobile configuration , hardwired thru the router , etc . when i click & # 34 ; wireless & # 34 ; on the settings menu the camera crash and needs to be rebooted manually . i tried to contact the technical support during business hours and i 've just get a voicemail . do not buy this camera , it seems great but it just does n't work ! what a waste of time ! ! ! grrrrr
__label__positive__ great price ! much better quality than i was expecting . very user friendly .
__label__neutral__ kinda weak , but ok for price
__label__positive__ so thrilled with this strap and the quality . perfect for my fujifilm instant camera !
__label__positive__ fun product - a party favorite ! we made magnets out of the photos for party favors !
__label__positive__ i love this little lens ! i like the manual aperture control on the lens its self . i have only used this camera on a nikon d5100 so i do n't know how good the autofocus is on it ( the d5100 cant autofocus this lens because there 's no autofocus on the camera body . but i do n't ever use autofocus anyways. < br / > < br / > this lens is sharp and lets in a lot of light . really big bokeh and its great for portraits or indoor photography . i would buy again , especially for the price . an amazing deal .
__label__positive__ hard to install because of the button on the cable .
__label__negative__ did not come with charger just batteries , remote and the battery connector is loose the way it fits in . also it gives a battery error and does not work .
__label__positive__ i love it . ca n't wait to take it on vacation next week . takes great pics and easy to use .
__label__neutral__ not the best
__label__positive__ i took a pinhole photography workshop and chose this camera after reading other reviews . i just got the filmed developed and the photos back . for my first try i have to say it did a great job . it was nice that it included a roll of 120 film as it can be hard to find . easy to load and use . the card that came with it that had the recommended exposure times was invaluable . i did n't really have any over/under exposure of my photos , and any issues i did have was because the light conditions were constantly changing that day . if you are looking to try pinhole photography i recommend this camera .
__label__positive__ i was browsing on amazon , looking for a camera straps to pair up with my sony a7 . i was about pass up on this strap because of the price and there was no review on it ; thankfully , i did n't . the quality ( handmade ) , the length , and thickest had me smile as i attached to my camera . do n't waste your time on those other cheap straps ( like i did ) . forgot to mention ... red straps with black camera goes well together ( just my preference ) .
__label__positive__ looking for an alternative battery other than canon well stop right here . i own now six of these batteries in which i have used them with my canon 6d , 5d mark 3 , and canon 7d and have had no problems what so ever . they work fine whether they are seated in a battery grip , or if they are in the camera stand alone . my oldest pair of these batteries are a year old and they still hold a charge and i can shoot up to six hours or more without changing them . they are totally compatible with canon cameras and will not give you any problems that i know of . i highly recommend and can assure you these are just as good as canon 's original battery if not better .
__label__positive__ i just got my package a week early ! it was so neatly packed and handled carefully , i am very impressed and would love to buy from this seller in the future . the quality of the products is fantastic , and i ca n't wait to go for a photography expedition with this pack ! after trying the lenses out , i was very impressed . the test photos i have taken are of great quality , and with my nikon d3200 , i now have the perfect pack to learn and expand on my photography skills . thank you for the quick delivery !
__label__positive__ really pretty good ... .
__label__positive__ work very well , although it is better suited for shorter lenses .
__label__positive__ after you get used to the way the lens opens , it 's very quick to turn on and snap the first pic . i am loving the manual zoom ring . pictures are fantastic and the low light capabilities are some of the best . the film color settings really are a highlight for me . looks authentic .
__label__neutral__ i have not used this item a lot , so this is kind of a & # 34 ; first impression & # 34 ; review . the first unit i received had a broken on/off switch , and i had to contact amazon for an exchange . the switch on the replacement unit was ok , but i have subtracted two stars on on my rating because of the switch . it is tiny , the movement from on to off is very little , and the switch protrudes from the end of the handle . it is extremely easy to accidentally turn it on , or off , or maybe even snap it off . it should be somehow recessed , or under a protective cover . that said , the unit came with no instructions , so i plugged in the included charging cord , a blue light came on , then went off after a while , so i guess it was charged ? the adjustable head to hold the phone is easy to use , and firmly holds either our older 4s , or newer 6 . the telescoping sections are a little stiff ( spouse had trouble closing them ) but suspect they may loosen in time . added later : should have noted that this item contains a re-chargeable battery . lacking an instruction book or sheet , i can see no way to remove or replace the battery . so , when it fails to hold a charge , which they all do after a while , the stick would be useless .
__label__positive__ light weight , easy to set up , does the job
__label__positive__ these work so well ! able to throw a full size dslr and clothing in here and it really keeps the air outside out and the air inside in . the big size is a bit too big for a small kayak ( would not fit in my dry bin ) , but it does crush down smaller .
__label__neutral__ absolute rubbish , this might as well just be a heavy tripod , the & # 34 ; fluid head & # 34 ; part of this tripod is non-existent i was only able to get semi smooth pans on the y axis which is useless to me , and this is after my first model was defective . do not buy , go for a manfrotto instead edit : company sent me a new head two months out of warranty , its still pretty heavy and the motion is still rather jagged but not nearly as bad as before . company was very attentive in correcting my initial complaint , calling me and offering to two day a new head over . pleased with the was they do buisness
__label__negative__ i should of listened to all the negative reviews i read about this product . i was super excited to receive this item , only to be disappointed . i initially bought this product to hang the back drop at a cake table for my child 's birthday party . as soon as i set up this item i child 's tell how wobbly and weak the structure was . this item is not even worth the cheap price you pay for it . it was n't about to hold up a thin fabric as soon as i hung the fabric the tubes began to bend even more then what they originally were bent . i 'm so disappointed .
__label__negative__ very disappointed with these filters . the threads do not seem to line up properly and they are difficult to get on and off . in fact , the uv filter actually fell off my camera as i was taking a picture over a cliff in portugal !
__label__positive__ cool
__label__negative__ stopped working ... customer service does not even respond !
__label__positive__ love the camera . finally found a camera that even a beginner can figure out . now next is to read the 200 page manual .
__label__positive__ this is by far the best camera i have ever had ! i 've had some very expensive ones and this samsung is much better than any of them . i am not one to take selfies so i do n't know if it 's a standard thing to have a selfie taking button . for this price , if you are looking for a camera , you wo n't be sorry !
__label__neutral__ flash is great , remote not so much . go with the flash only kit .
__label__positive__ encantada
__label__positive__ i was a little bummed when i found out i had to spend the additional cash after dropping $ 1,500 on the ikilite housing for my gh4 but after receiving this and trying it out in tahiti , it all went away . this is such a solid piece of gear ! very clear and although connecting it to the ikilite housing is a bit sketchy because it never stops spinning , my camera is perfectly safe after many dives in moving currents . 4 stars only because of price .
__label__positive__ thank you
__label__positive__ good low profile case , great for traveling .
__label__positive__ love it love the flowers and it looks so nice on my new purple camera thanks again
__label__positive__ like it a lot , but wish i had spent the additional $ $ $ to get the 55-300mm instead . probably would have been worth the money in the long run .
__label__positive__ bought as a replacement for an older set wanted better glass than i had . these are very clear and lightweight . i will be taking them on my next hunting trip .
__label__positive__ perfect little stand . i use it for long exposure shots on my galaxy camera which come out great . i can also use it for the auto timer feature .
__label__positive__ my son loves his camera , uses for youtube videos and his outdoor adventures !
__label__positive__ it work perfect . i had no problems with it .
__label__positive__ not just for go pro ! i put my regular digital camera in here so that whether i 'm climbing up a pyramid in mexico , storing my camera in my purse , or at sporting event , my digital camera is safe and sound . i bought quick release ends so that i can quickly put the whole case on a strap if i need to .
__label__positive__ great for taking quick snapshots and easy to carry around
__label__positive__ fast and quick on focus , somewhat noisy motor but does n't bother me . photos are crisp and great for blurring out the background . for the money it is a must have imo
__label__positive__ looks great
__label__positive__ nice little cleaning kit . spent the 3 grand to purchase the a7rii . the cleaning solution works beautifully on screens , lenses , and filters to remove all traces of finger prints when used with the microfiber cloth . the blower is good for blasting dust away , and the tear-open wipes are convenient . my only gripe is the twist-open brush is very easy to twist , and the brush is easily pushed back in the container during use . a little resistance would have been good here . otherwise , great kit .
__label__positive__ good product . a little hard to close ( as these styles are ) even with their very clear video , but i got it . the carrying case doesnt have a carrying strap , which would have been nice .
__label__negative__ poor life time
__label__positive__ i really like the arlo system ( which i actually found cheaper elsewhere , but anyways ) . it does exactly what i need without spending a long time running wires . a couple of things about it so you are not disappointed with your purchase : < br / > < br / > 1 . as others have stated , it is a security camera system , not a surveillance camera system . if you need to view/record more than a few minutes a day , this is not the system for you . you need something with a wired power source . this is not for commercial use , or checking in on your dog every five minutes. < br / > 2 . there is a definite delay before it starts recording after motion is detected ( well documented in the reviews ) . for me , the delay is about 1-2 seconds , not 2-8 . maybe i 'm just lucky , or maybe they have updated the firmware . in any event , i have my cameras positioned in strategic ways where this is a non-issue . it might be for you if you are going to monitor a small area. < br / > 3 . there is no sound . as all of my cameras are outdoors , i do n't care . if you place yours indoors , maybe an issue for you. < br / > 4 . batteries are still & # 34 ; full & # 34 ; after a month . this is directly related to how often you view/record , and outside temperature. < br / > 5 . installation and account set up was incredibly easy . i 've installed zmodo commercial cameras in my wife 's store that took about 4 hours to get working properly ( and i mean 4 hours after the wiring was done ) . these took about 10 minutes. < br / > 6 . they say these are hd . hmmm , i guess , but bottom line hd at best . my iphone takes much better video. < br / > < br / > so the bottom line is , do n't use them for what they are not intended to do , and in my experience , they will perform very well . hope this was helpful .
__label__positive__ i like the product very much and recommend it highly .
__label__neutral__ the colormunki colorimeter does reasonable job of setting profiles for lcd monitors , but the setup and execution are seriously flawed in annoying and stupid ways . three stars may be too generous , given these flaws. < br / > < br / > i have a mac mini purchased new in july 2015 , and it is running osx 10.10 . the primary monitor is a hp lp2575w with an excellent ips display . the secondary monitor is an aging samsung synchmaster 906bw . the software recognized both monitors and asked which one was being calibrated . the annoyances and stupid flaws are : < br / > < br / > the cd that comes in the package has version 1.0.1 of x-rite ’ s software . there ’ s no message one the cd offering to look for updated software . when i tried to install the mac version from the disk , it displayed a message saying that the software could not be installed on the internal hard drive ( which has over 1tb of free space ) . i went to the website and downloaded version 1.1.1 , which installed ok . the downloaded version is dated december 2013 , so x-rite has been shipping units for almost two years with cds that have outdated software . ( either that or the one i bought has been on amazon ’ s shelves for that long , which seems unlikely . ) < br / > < br / > second , after i plugged the colormunki into a usb port and started the software , it displayed a message saying that there was no colormunki detected . it was plugged into a powered usb hub , so i switched it to a port on the mac mini . same result – no colormunki detected . i had to reboot to get the software to find the colormunki . if i have to plug in directly , the opening screen or the printed quick start directions should tell me that ? and why isn ’ t it detected after it ’ s been moved from a hub to the computer ? if i should have rebooted after installing the software , tell me that ! < br / > < br / > third , i was calibrating dual monitors on the same mac mini . the software has a nice feature – it offers to match the display of the second monitor to the first . sounds good , but the match was inly so-so . when i selected the option that starts the second monitor 's calibration , second display was switched so that it appeared at the \primary display . it was necessary to open system preferences on the mac to switch back. < br / > < br / > the software offers two calibration modes – “ easy ” and “ advanced ” . it took about 14 minutes to run the “ advanced ” mode on the first monitor , and about 6 minutes to run the “ easy ” mode on the second monitor . monitors should be recalibrated every few weeks , but a 14-minute routine is a deterrent to checking calibration often. < br / > < br / > all in all , this unit is ok if you can live with the annoying flaws in the software and the slow calibration process in the advanced mode . the flaws should have be long gone by the time x-rite published version 1.1.1.o-so . when i selected the option that starts the second monitor 's calibration , second display was switched so that it appeared at the \primary display . it was necessary to open system preferences on the mac to switch back . the software offers two calibration modes – “ easy ” and “ advanced ” . it took about 14 minutes to run the “ advanced ” mode on the first monitor , and about 6 minutes to run the “ easy ” mode on the second monitor . monitors should be recalibrated every few weeks , but a 14-minute routine is a deterrent to checking calibration often . all in all , this unit is ok if you can live with the annoying flaws in the software and the slow calibration process in the advanced mode . the flaws should have be long gone by the time x-rite published version 1.1.1 .
__label__positive__ great product fits perfect in my nikon d5200 with the rokinon 500 mm i just bought .
__label__negative__ battery run out fast
__label__negative__ it came all broke
__label__positive__ excellent camera . very user friendly . great under water photos . wifi photo transfer is quick and easy . super product !
__label__positive__ for my slr just the right , appearance is very good-looking , quality is good , is a bit expensive .
__label__positive__ this is the best bang for the buck for huge binoculars . i replaced my spotting scope that was much more expensive . i like binoculars because there is less strain using both eyes . part of the focus adjustment is plastic and it flexes if you push on the eye piece . not a huge issue as long as you do n't push on the eye pieces . the glass seems very clear for the price . i purchased a pair for my dad for christmas . i ended up keeping them and purchased two more to give away as presents . they come with a tripod adapter which is nice because they are heavy .
__label__positive__ i got this tripod for my new lg g4 which has an extremely good camera for a smartphone and allows you to save the image in raw dng format , which is great for photo editing . i got it so i could take long exposure shots without having to hold the phone and take shots and videos of my daughter at dance recitals and when playing softball . this tripod fits the bill perfectly . the added bonus of having a monopod built it makes it even more valuable at sporting events where i can leave the tripod set up and grab the monopod and go to where the action is. < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > perfect height , perfect weight , handle to grab and go , easy to extend and put away , 2 levels , monopod , tight clip for the camera base , good solid construction , carry bag is nice and roomy and well constructed too < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > the panning could be smoother but for me , not a big issue . i also wish there was a manual to explain each adjustment . there is one adjustment screw at the base that does n't loosen anything so not sure what it is for ( should have taken a picture of it , but anyway ) < br / > < br / > overall , this is a great budget tripod for the amateur photographer and looking forward to having it for a long time
__label__positive__ i would give it a 5 stars if not for the fact that i have to have a tools in order to use it properly . i mean , the 'd ' part of the screw ( the part we handle ) is too small to twist . other than that , the product is good .
__label__positive__ i am as picky as one can be when it comes to quality but careful when comes to spending . this looks and feels like the original cap and costed a fraction of that . i love it , i 'll get another one just to be sure they wo n't go off the market .
__label__negative__ i got the product in great time frame and it worked fine for the first few uses . as i had to take the battery in & out , the buttons on both sides of the battery case broke so now the battery wo n't go down which causes the door not to close . i ca n't use the grip now . i just missed the 30 day return deadline by 2 days .
__label__positive__ its kind of slow compared to my older sony camera . low light photography is horrible , pixeled out ghost images. < br / > < br / > but as a package this is the best you could get . another seller is selling just the camera for the same rate . the silver one is around 18 bucks less , but for that 18 bucks you get an 16gb sony sd card , camera pouch , lens cleaner , wipes , and screen protector. < br / > < br / > i can tell the camera pouch and the sd card itself woud be worth the 18 dollars if you buy separately .
__label__neutral__ great
__label__positive__ excellent set of lens filters for an even better price !
__label__positive__ i purchased this because i wanted to branch out and not only use nikon products . i looked at a few lenses and based on the reviews , i knew this was going to be a great fit . on the day that it arrived , i took it out of the box and immediately started snapping photos . here are a few things that i noticed : < br / > < br / > 1 ) this lens does n't have a very large aperture , so it 's not meant for low-light conditions . your exposure time needs to go up . not necessarily the fault of the lens , but if you expect to take some quick exposures in shadows , you 'll have to bump up the iso. < br / > < br / > 2 ) this is not a silent motor . it makes some noise , so if you 're out to shoot some wildlife , you might want to go into manual mode. < br / > < br / > 3 ) speaking of the auto-focus , this one has a hard time focusing on the exact object that you want . this could just be due to how close i was getting to them , but i 've been closer with my nikon lenses and have n't had this issue. < br / > < br / > 4 ) the speed of the auto focus is n't as quick as nikon and even if you 're already focused on your subject , it likes to recalibrate itself , so do n't expect this to be a zippy lens. < br / > < br / > 5 ) when you 're focused properly , the images are very sharp . i have no complaints about the quality of the image. < br / > < br / > 6 ) the macro feature is great ! at first , i did n't realize you needed a minimum of 200mm to switch it on , so that took some getting used to. < br / > < br / > 7 ) the lens is a little heavy and will require a tripod if you zoom in , but if you 're going 200mm+ you should be using a tripod anyways. < br / > < br / > i would have loved to give this lens 5 stars , but the quality and speed of the auto focus and leaves a bit to be desired . i would absolutely recommend this and i actually have recommended it to a friend who has a canon . i do n't regret my purchase at all !
__label__negative__ strap is comfortable , but the ends do n't stay secure enough without gradually pulling through . as a result , one of them gave way on me , and i ended up with a broken camcorder and an expensive repair bill after it fell onto pavement .
__label__positive__ works well with my battery and seems to be durable
__label__positive__ i love this camera and i 'm sure there are plenty of positive and negative reviews so i wo n't go crazy . just a few key pluses and minuses. < br / > < br / > positive : < br / > -user settings option to retain my favorite settings for instant access < br / > -killer zoom < br / > -surprisingly good low light capabilities < br / > -adjustable flash exposure < br / > < br / > negative < br / > -slow to startup < br / > -slow to take pictures unless you know how to customize the settings. < br / > -issues acquiring focus depending on zoom level , ambient light , level of detail , and proximity to target ( a common issue with all ultra - zoom cameras )
__label__positive__ worked well during my wife 's european trip . simple and functional .
__label__neutral__ it 's a good camera but very bad mount . it kept falling out of its mount while car was moving so i returned it . they tried reasoning with me to make me doubt how well i mounted it , but this is n't my first rodeo . i know how to mount these things and this is n't my fault . they need to improve the mount. < br / > < br / > they returned my money off course . so i am satisfied .
__label__negative__ this does not work on my sony a58 . it messes with something an have a hard time powering up my camera . i am just hoping it did not mess with my camera plugging it in.. i want to return it and it says i can not . there has to be a way to return it , and get my money back .
__label__positive__ good size , well padded , extra storage space , good price , and well built .
__label__negative__ i bought two of the same battery for my d300 nikon . one battery does not register in the camera . i have charged it fully but it does not work . the other battery works fine . because i waited too long , i have no recourse and have wasted $ $ . next battery purchase will be with someone who honors their sales longer than this . i have been shooting with this same camera for over 8 years and i know the battery life is 4-5 years , based on my level of use . they should be warranted for longer time .
__label__positive__ a real nice camera case .
__label__positive__ impressed with the image for the size . need to figure out how to mount it . it would have been nice had they provided min/max voltage and current for the camera module . other reviewers say 5 volts will drive the camera module .
__label__positive__ i was skeptical , but they work great . we have added quite a few to our photography deployments . the ir assist beam is too direct and is annoying at weddings but you can pop off the translucent red panel and put some diffusing paper or plastic in there and it still works great without the annoying red grid being cast on everything in sight . i have n't had any reliability issues , but we just bought extras so we either have extra lighting options or if some fail , we have backups to get our essential shots done .
__label__positive__ it work great . it is simple to use . now the printer results match the computer look .
__label__positive__ my husband has not complained at all !
__label__positive__ fast and as expected
__label__positive__ perfect little container with premade slots for my basic gopro equipment .
__label__positive__ great product ! quick charging and long lasting
__label__positive__ comfortable and stylish
__label__positive__ received the items as listed . the batteries do get stuck in the charger , but somehow my boyfriend fixed it with a screwdriver . the batteries work great , though . he says maybe they do n't last quite as long as oem , but for the price difference , they 're worth it .
__label__positive__ was for son-in-law and grandsons . they love it .
__label__positive__ great buy !
__label__positive__ this is my second of these . i bought this so i could keep another system of gear ready to go . great bag , the shoulder strap is long enough to wear bandolier style , and i 'm a big guy .
__label__positive__ item delivered on time , was as described
__label__positive__ day/night click nose , very loud . other then that , its a good camera to have .
__label__positive__ great softboxes , one is a bit unsteady , but with some adjustment wo n't tip over .
__label__negative__ i really love the large reflector on this , but it came with zero instructions on how to set it up so i still do n't think i 'm putting it together properly . i have a hard time getting the set up to work . pretty disappointed that it does n't have instructions .
__label__positive__ my son loves it and uses it in our pool a lot .
__label__positive__ best camera i have ever used . this is the first compact camera that i have experienced to produce stunning professional results with a point and shoot automatic . the only thing that needs improvement on is the shape of the camera itself . it is a bit awkward to hold for shooting . but other than that it is a terrific performer . i would recommend this to anybody interested in taking great photo with ease .
__label__positive__ got a a pack for my girlfriend and they fit like a charm with no issues after taking the pictures . good stuff !
__label__positive__ i bought my samsung nx mini camera for my trip to ireland . the case for the camera was perfect . i had it over my shoulder the whole time , very durable and convenient . super easy to take the cover off whenever i wanted to snap a pic too .
__label__positive__ works great
__label__positive__ just what i needed
__label__negative__ would not pair with the phantom 2 vision plus - i have 2 , phantom 2 vision plus and it would n't pair with either one of them . i am sending it back on 7/23/2015 . this controller does n't pair as advertised .
__label__positive__ just flat out an amazing camera and an amazing kit . i took many professional looking pictures with this camera . i went to china to see pandas and they came out perfect even from 20 feet . i won a photo contest too with those pictures .
__label__positive__ i do photography full-time professionally and have always used these papers to clean my lenses , with zeiss spray lens cleaner . they do n't shred or leave lint .
__label__positive__ this mini tripod is great for digital recorders or microphones with adapter , but the 1/4-20 screw is pretty short , even with the adjusting plate turned all the way down . tascam dr60d and dr60dmkii only have one turn of thread when mounted , so i put another mini ball mount on top which has a longer screw . rock steady mini-tripod !
__label__positive__ nice case that fits the lumix just right .
__label__negative__ not sure how you can say you support mac if you do n't support any browsers that are used on mac .
__label__neutral__ the fix for the battery is a bit loose but , it does the trick for the price .
__label__positive__ really a 4.5
__label__positive__ fits the yi perfectly . all the buttons work . looking forward to testing underwater. < br / > other reviews reported scratches/blurriness on the lens , remember to peel the protective film .
__label__neutral__ it s ok
__label__positive__ item as described , great product .
__label__positive__ works great on my old canon g7 which someone handed me down . increases the camera 's zoom for long shots like in an auditorium and widens field for cramped places such as the tiny living room in my house . well worth the price .
__label__positive__ terrific set
__label__positive__ what kind of memory card would work for it
__label__positive__ fits easily into a man 's front pocket ( but i use a case , just in case ) . fast start-up . very little lag between shots ( except low-light situations ) . excellent photo quality . if the best camera is the one you have with you , then i expect to take a lot of great photos , because this one wo n't be left at home very often .
__label__positive__ not enough for a full moon with my scope . great quality product though . it might be enough for other phases , but not full . still debating on getting a polarized ( adjustable 1 % to 40 % ) . the picture shows a side by side comparison between the 25 % and the 13 % .
__label__positive__ great product and very good . very easy to use and easily set up !
__label__neutral__ it came with a dead battery .
__label__negative__ the speaker on this camera sucks . but other than that , it has amazing picture quality. < br / > < br / > update** < br / > < br / > nest apparently recently updated the software so that to see anything from the past day , you have to pay for a nest aware subscription . this completely lowers my opinion of this product and at 200 bucks , it 's just not even worth it . i could have gotten a 50 dollar ptz camera from groupon and it would have been better than what i 'm getting from this camera now .
__label__positive__ amazing product definitely not a fake i highly recommend it . no problems with delivery or the product itself . comes with a lot of accessories ! love it !
__label__neutral__ does not put out much light unless you are in a very small and controlled environment .
__label__positive__ as a professional photographer , i paid hundreds of dollars for radio slaves . i bought this set for teaching a class , not expecting much . i was very surprised . they work as the should , every time . if you want to use optical slaves with 3rd party speedlights along with wireless from your camera maker ... you ca n't ! the pop up flash pre-flashes , and fires your optical slaved units. < br / > < br / > this is the solution . if you are using a canon or nikon flash off camera and want to do a 4 light set up on the cheap , this lets you do it . i trigger a canon 580 ex and 550 ex with the triggers , and they trigger the neewer tt560 via their built in optical slaves ( a $ 35 manual speedlight ! ) . i would recommend this without hesitation , and i will be demonstrating them in my udemy class , & # 34 ; how to create studio portraits when you do n't have a studio. & # 34 ; great product .
__label__positive__ easy and quick to put together . produce good results for our product shoot . documentation is good . also provides helpful tips on how to get the best result .
__label__negative__ could not get this to fit into the slot on my camera even though it looks like it should . i double checked the camera model and made sure the old charger still fit ( just stopped working for some reason ) . so , the problem is definitely with this cord .
__label__positive__ this is exactly what i was looking for ! i recently started shooting youtube videos and had another table top tripod that was way too short ! so short i had to stack it on several thick books to get the height i needed . this tripod is super sturdy and it can expand to fit whatever type of table top shooting you need . it comes with a nice bag to store it in .
__label__positive__ exactly as described , works excellent ! bought as a gift specifically for the moon filter and they are greatly impressed with the quality and viewing capabilities that this kit offers as a suppliment to their celestron telescope .
__label__positive__ great price . easy to use .
__label__positive__ highly recommend this one over the aluminum . the legs are much more sturdy . very easy to use and the easy release ball head works great . it is a great deal for a great product . i much rather have this one for $ 100 versus an over priced one .
__label__positive__ my fave camera ! love every feature and the resulting photo !
__label__positive__ great niche camera .
__label__negative__ poor quality pics !
__label__positive__ great camera , takes very nice pictures . love how its so portable .
__label__negative__ does print pics but some come out with streaks
__label__negative__ bought this lens just a few weeks back . i 've taken maybe 40 to 50 pictures with it and its gone defective already ! seems as the aperture ring turns a complete 360 around the lens making no adjustment . i understand the old saying you get what you pay for and i guess this is par for the course ! i 've contacted altura , the seller and amazon waiting for a response . will keep all updated !
__label__negative__ camera took 4 hours to connect to d-link account not 30 minutes per instruction . camera turned on night vision during the day and would not turn off despite factory reset . night vision shoots about 5 feet not 15 as promised . camera also spent 3 days offline even though i reset it , connected directly to ethernet , and followed all the support instructions to the letter and the camera still would n't function according to specs . when it did work , the camera only recorded 4 seconds of video then stopped recording for 15 seconds then started for another 4 seconds , despite claims of recording up to 100 seconds for motion detection .
__label__neutral__ great little camera for the dough , great video . batteries do not last very long , however bought some spare . the case cracked at the hinges with very little stress , so i only give it 3 stars . the accessories are great . not bad for the price .
__label__positive__ great +++
__label__positive__ exactly what i needed ! works like a charm .
__label__positive__ as advertised .
__label__positive__ they work great on all glass materials . i 'm very satisfied .
__label__positive__ this is a great camera bag , very nice design . i like the fact that you can remove the camera case insert and use it as a regular backpack . my only complaint is that the camera compartment is a little small . i bought this bag to use for an overseas vacation . i hoped that the 22l would allow me to bring my full-frame dslr ( canon 6d ) and three zooms ( 16-35 , 24-70 , 70-200 ) but it 's not large enough . the most that you can fit into the camera compartment is body+lens plus another lens ( after configuring the compartment many different ways , i was able to squeeze in my canon 6d w/16-35 attached and the 70-200 next to it ( a very tight fit for the 70-200 ) . the 24-70 had to go into the upper bag area where there is little protection . i wish lowepro had made the camera compartment just a little bit larger to fit everything , but it 's still a great backpack and i plan to use it on my vacation . update : i decided to travel smarter and leave the big , heavy glass at home . i bought a tamron 28-300mm lens to replace my 24-70 and 70-200 lenses , kept the 16-35 for wide shots , and threw in a nifty-fifty f/1.8 for low light shots . everything fits perfectly inside the 22l 's camera compartment ( plus my bag is 4 pounds lighter ! )
__label__negative__ guys come on , this is not good . product came used , with signs of wear and tear , scratches and a missing grip . the product works , no doubt . but seriously ?
__label__positive__ used on alaska cruise . very satisfied .
__label__positive__ just perfect ! thank you ! works great !
__label__positive__ after reading the reviews and seeing as it was a recommendation based upon the camera i now have , i finally went ahead and purchased this case . today , i received the case in the mail and when i went to place my panasonic lumix fz70 in it , i had to actually lay it face down inside the case in order for it to fit . there is n't much room elsewhere to really put my accessories . even the side zipper pockets are a little small for what i want to put in there . aside from that , i am happy with purchase .
__label__negative__ trash ! ! ! ! ! ! original battery with 1030mah working in two times longer than this batteries with 2300 mah
__label__positive__ beautifully hand crafted leather half case for the fuji x100t . perfect fit and finish . hinged bottom flap makes the battery and sd card slots easily accessible without the need to remove the camera from the case . seller also included a solid brass tripod bushing , and complementary leather hand strap . highly recommended .
__label__positive__ compact and useful . wish i had had one of these years ago .
__label__positive__ i really like
__label__positive__ working fine in my nikon camera . additional car charger . very good deal .
__label__positive__ works well - did have it jump off the network once and re-establish a connection with a different ip address but was easily fixed .
__label__positive__ i really love this camera . i am the kind who never has the time to get my prints at the local store so i looked at many instant cameras . i am glad i choose this one . i recommend everyone should get one . plus it is easy to get school projects done fast !
__label__positive__ good product for a great price . well built and compact . does n't handle quite like a large scale steady-cam but that is to be expected with a compact version . comes with additional weights to get the balance just right . after playing around with it and getting a feel for the balance i am very pleased with how my footage looks . great addition to the weekend warrior 's arsenal of video equipment . no more shaky gopro footage when shooting hand held shots !
__label__positive__ it served its purpose for the kids and they enjoy watching their videos of them !
__label__neutral__ it is a good camera for the proice , do n't expect good picture with low light but during daytime it takes good quality pictures the same as video , the only thing i would change is the fact that uses aa batteries so you need to keep at least another set of rechargeable batteries with you all the time .
__label__neutral__ i could not use it with my camera , but the product was as advertised . returned with no problem .
__label__positive__ excellent . my neoprene lunch bag no longer jumps around . plus it feels good on my shoulder
__label__positive__ connects very quickly with other yongnuo and canon products .
__label__positive__ i 've had this lens for almost 5 years now and i have not regretted getting it for even a second . at around a hundred dollars it just ca n't be beat . it 's sturdy , reliable , and takes stunning pictures . i like traveling light when it comes to my camera so this lens works perfectly for me . with the right lighting you can get superb pictures of just about anything . the colors turn out so vibrant too ! < br / > < br / > if you 're working on taking better pictures without spending a small fortune on a lens then this is the lens you 're looking for . once you see the difference between this and the kit lens this will instantly become your go to lens . some people have complained about the plastic build of this lens , but honestly it has n't bothered me at all . it makes it lightweight and keeps the price down without sacrificing picture quality . like i said , i 've used this lens weekly for nearly five years and it looks and works as good as when it was brand new .
__label__positive__ super easy to set up that only took a couple minutes . no computer needed , nor do you have to plug it directly into a router ( it does have the outlets on back if unit if you want to ) . i just plugged into electric outlet , linked it to my iphone , once linked i could set it up on my secure wireless wifi . instructions were short and easy to follow . picture quality is n't hd or anything but satisfactory for the price . surprised how well it worked in the dark . i got as a novelty to spy on my dogs and cat while away . has a motion sensor and alert set up for mobile device . access from phone is free but more features are available with a service fee to security app ( motion sensor alert on phone and recording stored to cloud ) . good news is that there is a one month free trial of this to see if you really want to use it or if it is just a toy then the novelty could wear off with out extra cost .
__label__negative__ very poor pictures !
__label__positive__ great little tri pod ! sturdier than i imaged and easy to use . love it !
__label__positive__ fantastic bag ! this easily holds my equipment and the amount of pockets it has is priceless ! i can easily keep 1 dslr and 3 film cameras inside of this bag ! its perfect for hiking or camping since it has a waterproof bag and overall the build quality is very nice !
__label__negative__ its a piece of s*** . totally useless . quality is soo bad n blury . waste of money
__label__negative__ though most of the attachments seem fine ( time will tell ) , the monopole is virtually useless . the telescoping segments rotate without much effort , so the weight of a gopro is sufficient to rotate the pole segments and flip the camera upside down . oct 12th . update : eric , of luxebell , commented on this review , suggesting i get in touch with the company to remedy the problem . clearly this was & # 34 ; window dressing & # 34 ; for public consumption . having contacted the company twice , i have had no response in over a month . do not buy from this company . defective products and non-existent customer suppport
__label__positive__ absolutely love my polaroid ! easy to use and small enough to carry around ! although the polaroid can easily get scuff marks on . the best way to use the polaroid is by watching a video on how to use so every picture will come out great !
__label__positive__ excellent filters they work great ! take photos during the worst high sub hours without washout .
__label__neutral__ the bottle is empty
__label__positive__ great product . mounts securely and is right where you need it . easy to remove the remote for charging
__label__positive__ hey , they 're batteries ! we needed to replace the & # 34 ; 123 & # 34 ; lithium battery for a weather station . since that was the last one we had , we immediately shopped to buy some more . this was the best deal at the moment for a reasonable quantity . six batteries should last us for about a year or two ; we do n't have too many devices that use the & # 34 ; 123 & # 34 ; size . it did n't make sense to buy more and have them sit around. < br / > < br / > we like the energizer & # 34 ; 123 & # 34 ; batteries , because they last a long time . we are consistently satisfied with energizer. < br / > < br / > hint : be sure to shop around on amazon every time you buy these ! so many sellers offer energizer & # 34 ; 123 & # 34 ; batteries at an incredible range of prices . there 's no rhyme or reason to it . be sure to look at the whole price , including the batteries , shipping , and tax , because some sellers offer a low per-battery price and then nail you on shipping .
__label__positive__ good stuff
__label__positive__ when so much has been written by pixel peepers and those with professional photographer credentials , it 's a bit intimidating for a casual enthusiast to attempt to review something as complex as pentax da 18-135 lens . i have no fancy testing apparatus , no stands , no charts . just good eye sight and a keen sense of color , texture , clarity , and depth . these four element are kind of what we 're looking for in our photos , i think ? i do n't spend a lot of time scanning for rare purple fringes , vignettes ( sometimes i even introduce a pleasing vignette when using lightroom ... ) , or solar flaring causing by pointing the camera too directly toward sunlight . i do n't expend much energy in pushing a lens to its limits to see if i can detect tiny aberrations from my expectations . with the powerful jpeg processor in my pentax k-s1and fabulous coating on the lens , i do n't have to worry about barrel distortion , pin cushioning or flaring and problems with focusing with the superb 18-135 are almost non-existent . now , with those disclaimers out of the way ... < br / > < br / > i like pentax equipment from the day i first owned one . i 've enjoyed other products as well including the canon 60d , olympus em5 , and the sony nex 7 along with lots of heavy glass with red lines , green lines , gold lines , plastic , metal , with many exotic coatings and designations . still own 1 of each . but the most fun , versatile , and pleasing combination i 've encountered for both day-to-day and excursion photography is the mid-level pentax k-s1 and the da 18-135mm . why do i like the 18-135 ? i thought you 'd never ask : < br / > < br / > size : the 18-135 is 2.87 x 2.87 x 2.99 inches - not much larger than the standard da 18-55 wr which is 2.72 x 2.72 x 2.68 inches < br / > weight : the 18-135 is .89 lbs - the 18-55 .49 lbs - both lens coming in at a desirable weight below 1 lb keeping the combined weight of your gear acceptable low for walkaround photog. < br / > sharpness : in the eye of the beholder , but after taking 40 or so photos with each lens at my local duck pond and comparing them with my equipment ( i.e , 20/20 vision eyeballs ) the 18-135 is unquestionably sharper than the 18-55 edge to edge. < br / > focus : the 18-55 has the old fashioned mechanical screw drive which is somewhat noisy and not remarkably fast ; the 18-135 has pentax 's dc micromotor that is almost silent and provided near instantaneous focus for all shots. < br / > zoom : the 18-55 has a 3x optical zoom , the 18-135 has a 7.5x optical zoom . no competition here in terms of which has the best walkabout zoom range. < br / > rendition : now , you do n't hear a lot about this word in most of the reviews of cameras and lens - so heres my take on the 18-135 's ability to render an image or photograph for processing through the pentax prime m 2 processor . have you ever looked at an image and said wow ! that almost looks 3d . the sharpness and clarity are so life-like on the hd monitor or tv , it 's hard to describe . the colors are crisp and true to the subject and have a realism that is hard to define . now , this is not to say that the 18-55 is any slouch . it delivered nice well-rendered duck pond images that are well-lighted across the frame . but in comparing the images with those of the 18-135 , i could only come up with one word that describes the difference : that word is & # 34 ; flat & # 34 ; . the 18-55 photos are & # 34 ; flatter & # 34 ; and do n't have the & # 34 ; realism & # 34 ; or vibrancy and clarity ( contrast ? ) presented by those of the 18-135 . hope that makes sense . bottom-line , the 18-135 images are what my eyes and brain tell me my photos should look like - the 18-55 images , while nice , fall just short of my expectations. < br / > < br / > at $ 285 for a used & # 34 ; like new & # 34 ; 18-135 , with lens caps , hood i feel like i have a real fine set of photographic tools in hand . rumors are that ricoh has discontinued the lens and i see that prices are dropping quickly . i can fully recommend this to anyone who wants a sharp , versatile , general purpose mid-range telephoto lens for walkaround or casual photography . oh and by the way , put a nice circular polarizer on that rascal and you 're in for some blue sky picture taking treats .
__label__negative__ its not great
__label__positive__ amazing lens , built like a tank , i really love the build quality and the results .
__label__positive__ installed these in our business for security purposes . i 'm impressed with the video and recording capabilities . set up did n't take that long but is not quite as intuitive as i would hope for others . there is a web interface as well after initial set up . this is extremely helpful instead of using the mouse to click letters on a visual keyboard . the only downfall is that i can not get the email alerts to work but i think with some tinkering i 'll have that resolved soon
__label__positive__ excellent product
__label__positive__ wow !
__label__positive__ it works very well but i put my first pack of film in it and i got 3 pictures out of it and then the rest would n't come out so i had to waste almost a completely full pack of film .
__label__positive__ i do video marketing for local businesses and use this with my d5100 to record conversational style videos. < br / > the quality of this mic 's audio is a massive upgrade from my cameras default mic . i would say to any videographer out there , this is a must have considering its so inexpensive .
__label__negative__ nothing like i expected . i expected a better sun flair not just lines . could n't get my camera to focus because of the lines . i took several photos trying to compensate for the lines but nothing helped . would not recommend this filter
__label__positive__ hope its works as good as it sound if that true it will be great
__label__negative__ great product
__label__positive__ i received mine in the time that said it would arrive . very happy with my new drone . great power .
__label__neutral__ product is great and works but it mentioned coming with a lens cleansing cloth , which it did not .
__label__positive__ use this on my nikon d3200 . very happy with this flash . good value .
__label__positive__ great quality , fits nicely , footage looks great . everything i 've bought from smatree has been great quality - these guys definitely get it right !
__label__positive__ like one of the other reviewers , i also just returned a celestron 15x70mm sky masters , and i agree that those were total junk . i tries two pairs and both had awful double vision . these orion 's are so much better ! but they are also a lot heavier . so i ca n't use without a tripod , which is fine. < br / > < br / > last night was my first night looking at the stars . i saw pluto , saturn , and neptune , albeit they are nothing more than sparkling diamonds in the distance , but still ... the real fun was looking at nebulae and just being hypnotized . on a tripod these glasses are great . the optics are perfect and the hard case is a big plus . i 'm sold on this brand . i hope they make telescopes .
__label__negative__ the quality of the camera is great ! the documentation is lousy at best . the website is lousy at best . it is ridiculous to market a product in the united states with documentation that is so grammatically incorrect and hard to read it is all but useless . same with the web site . however , if you have some knowledge of cameras and how to set them up , perhaps it would not be so bad . i really did like the camera , but there are probably others for the same money that are equally as good and have better documentation and web support .
__label__positive__ loved it : )
__label__positive__ great value
__label__positive__ works as described . i have a larger unit and needed a smaller unit to photograph jewelry .
__label__negative__ to start with , the canvas boxes in which they come are the poorest quality posible . the packege i got , did not include the bateríes .
__label__positive__ mostly everything was what i expected and works well , except for the teeny tripod . it has no value to me !
__label__positive__ got mine at very good price from amazon partner . nice finish and looks very professional. < br / > weather and illness has prevented night testing but daytime nature views excellent .
__label__positive__ great product - great seller
__label__positive__ excellent fit and finish . low profile works great with the optical vf..
__label__positive__ excellent , thank you very macth
__label__positive__ very happy with this lens . used it on a full moon shoot and was pleased with the results . for the price , ca n't go wrong .
__label__positive__ i love this lens . it 's not perfect , but for & # 60 ; $ 100 i did not expect it to be . at first i had difficulty getting any usable photos as the auto focus would not settle . i tried to hold and sometime would not get a shot in over 10 seconds . i switched to aperture priority and single point focus ( center ) and most of the issues went away - at least in daylight . i use this for casual sports photos of the kids and it works great for this . the reach is great and i am able to get photos that i have never been able to get before . it 's also very useful for getting & # 34 ; in the moment & # 34 ; shots because your are further away and not directly interacting with your subjects . images are sharp if you can get the focus . we also swap out zoom lens for closer lens quite frequenter and the lens has been durable enough to handle the switches .
__label__positive__ i purchased 3 of these to use as gun cases . for sub compact guns they are the one to get ( 1200 series ) .
__label__positive__ going to be fun using on vacation
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ i bought it for my wife as a gift , she is the camera hobbyist , she loves it so much , it adding to the quality of the pictures so much , also very easy storage , is n't bulky , nice case
__label__positive__ actually pretty good quality . it was simple to put together , and surprisingly easy to transport .
__label__positive__ this is an impressive light for the price . i mostly use it to bounce light off of other walls and i get a clean , usable light out of that . i took photos at a wedding in a dark aquarium with this light and it worked better than i expected ! excellent value !
__label__positive__ i was n't able to find an official release plate for my dynex dx-trp60 that would arrive in time for a wedding . i read on a different website that the qb-4w would fit . i was unsure because the model of my tripod was not listed as compatible with this generic product , but it looked exactly like the one i lost , so i bought it . it was just a little too big to fit on the tripod so i used sandpaper to file it down and it now fits perfectly .
__label__positive__ the altura photo lens cap keeper holders were exactly what i needed . i can now use my camera without trying to figure out what to do with the lens cap . the holders were easy to install on my lens caps and i was even able to use one to secure the sun shade that was not reversible for storage . i recommend this item and this seller without reservation .
__label__negative__ this camera is not hd picture really grainy the battery wo n't hold a charge it has trouble reading the memory cards light not bright enough to do anything overall cheap junk not worth the money or time wasted would like to send it back for refund and get better one guess that 's what i get for buying generic crap
__label__positive__ great -- fits snugly and makes the camera look better , too
__label__positive__ great camera and cost/benefit for the kit . it really worths it .
__label__negative__ battery did n't fit . sent back . sender very cooperative .
__label__positive__ thank you so much revived my item and very happy with it ! ! i love my lens and also thank you for the prompt shipping very happy would do business again !
__label__positive__ i used this for other led fixtures and works well .
__label__positive__ very good .
__label__positive__ very nice item at a very reasonable price
__label__neutral__ ok i guess , it was a gift
__label__positive__ good product .
__label__positive__ another fantastic kit ! ! lots of great mounting options with this accessories set . all the gear is comparable to oem gear from gopro . it has all held up really well and i am happy with it . no issues with any of the mounts at all . some of the nuts on the backside of the mounts may come loose , but a bit of gorilla glue and that is cured quickly . all the double sided tape has been fantastic . no issues with any of it coming loose ever . we have torture tested this stuff out on a lake and it 's all held tight and water had no affect on it . never came loose once . good quality tape for sure . lots of fun to be had and filmed with this bunch of goods . thanks for this. < br / > < br / > i received this product at a discounted price to provide my fair and honest opinion . this is my opinion based on testing and reviewing the item .
__label__positive__ great quality . had a sony as100v prior to this camera . the hero4 is definitely a step up in overall quality . the touchscreen is extremely useful . easy menu system .
__label__positive__ oh my gosh i had bought this camera from amazon and it was great ! ! it was in good condition , the pictures it took were amazing , and it was so pretty ! ! it was exactly what i was expecting xd if you want to buy this camera ... buy it here from amazon ! ! !
__label__positive__ = )
__label__neutral__ i did n't like it 's not my expectation
__label__positive__ what a great deal . the batteries are really why i bought this and they are effect the other accessories are ok
__label__positive__ as described , great product .
__label__positive__ love it , better than i thought
__label__positive__ 100 % recomendable
__label__negative__ not onvif
__label__negative__ it does not work . no service what ever that means ...
__label__positive__ some of the itomes are cheap plastic it cam to my house with the handle bar mount already striped
__label__negative__ so i am writing this review so low because i was hoping to use this as a baby monitor , then when my baby is older use it as general surveillance camera around the house. < br / > < br / > unfortunately the camera will only send notifications detecting movement and noise once every 30 minutes . obviously if i 'm trying to monitor an infant over night i need to be alerted more often than that. < br / > < br / > if i get one alert then do n't get another one for another 30 minutes , my baby could be freaking out that whole time and i would n't know because the first alert did n't get my attention. < br / > < br / > if they allow users to choose the intervals of notifications ( notify me every 5min or 15min or 30min etc ) then i 'd give it 5 starts , but without that it 's useless for me. < br / > < br / > nest , if you guys ever put that ability in your software , let me know . for now , i 'm off to return the camera i just bought .
__label__positive__ good tool
__label__positive__ thanks for the package . everything is great and in good quality .
__label__positive__ for the price , you cant beat it , but one thing you need to watch out for is that it is very easy to bend the battery pins using this type of charger , thats why if you look at the gopro battery charger the batteries slid in to the connectors instead of being pressed down into the charger . the products themselves work awesomely . i say if you have the extra money lying around get a good gopro charger and buy just the batteries . i would buy this again though if i needed another one . cant beat that price .
__label__positive__ good
__label__neutral__ i spy on my employees
__label__negative__ it does not seat as well as the gopro factory made part . it 's a little loose . if you compare the gopro made part and this copy you will see that the two are not identical . the ridge in the middle is different . the copy 's ridge in the middle is smaller and causes the gopro part to not seat firmly
__label__positive__ i have found that when taking pictures with it , it works best on 1 to 2 subjects and only close up . so if that is what you need it for then i would suggest it . it is tricky when you have glasses . it leaves the circle light on them .
__label__positive__ wireless security camera with motion sensor and night vision . easy to set up , install and start using indoor or out . it 's heat sensor motion detection , so has to be within about twenty feet of place or items you want watched and ca n't be thru a tinted window etc .
__label__positive__ awesome camera . easy to use -- especially after reading the manual ( or at least the part about the lighting ) . pictures are about credit-card size .
__label__negative__ did n't fit . did n't work . did n't charge .
__label__positive__ i love this bag ! ! its very cute and is surprisingly well made . it looks just like the pictures . i can fit the camera , an extra film pack , my phone , and chapstick in it . ( i may end up just using it as a purse ! ) the only issue is really a non issue : the inside smells a bit when it first arrives , however it airs out pretty quickly .
__label__negative__ i bought this flash . used it twice and now it will not power on . i tried switching out the batteries and everything . if you want it to work once or twice , great flash . if you want to get multiple uses out of it , forget it . it wo n't last . terrible product . i will not buy another yongnuo product again . i am sticking to the nikon sb series flashes from now on .
__label__positive__ this lens is amazing . i just received it today and it 's definitely going down as my number one lens . i highly recommend this to anyone who is having doubts , as you will love this . the price is spectacular as well .
__label__negative__ so so
__label__positive__ netgear did it right with this one - easy to install and set up . clear picture and easy access from anywhere . setting the sensitivity is a little tricky but easy to change . like the e-mail notification for detecting motion . wish it would run longer than 2 minutes when detecting but that would burn batteries . overall , a+ .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ everything is great about this case except one thing : i wish it were smaller or more form-fitting to my camera ( nikon d5300 with 18-55 mm lens .
__label__negative__ item does not work , tried recharging several times . clicked on and off and still does not work . charger show battery is green and should be charged .
__label__positive__ solid , twists on the lens the same way you mount it to the camera body .
__label__negative__ edit 8/16/15 taking off 3 stars i just noticed an optical aberration that 's pretty bad . the right side of the images taken with the camera are very blurry . i thought it was because my helmet was in frame and it was messing up the auto focus , but it turns out it 's permanent . i will initiate an exchange , and see if the next unit has the same problem . if it 's ok , i 'll bring back the original 5 star rating . picture quality is great for the price . the only issue i have is that the mic is pretty well useless . wind noise is so strong above 20mph , you ca n't hear anything . i found i get 5 to 10 % more battery life by disabling the mic , and using my phone to record audio . camera lens angle is adequate for the intended use . if you attach it your helmet , look for a curved mounting plate . i was too cheap to buy one , so i just designed one in maya , and printed it out on my printrbot real fast . seems to be holding just fine . also , at 1080p the videos are broken up in to 300mb clips about 3 min each ( give or take ) . i have n't figured out how to store the files in larger segments , and it may not even have that feature . it 's pretty easy to stitch together in your favorite video editing software , though . just an extra step i could do without . my perfect moto-cam would have wifi/blutooth microphone and a +170* camera lens .
__label__positive__ i love this bag ! quality materials and a good price . i highly recommend it .
__label__positive__ it was a very good choice everything has worked well with no problems .
__label__negative__ trying to fold this green screen up is like trying to win a fight with an anaconda . it flops around everywhere and is a complete headache .
__label__positive__ love it ! no more losing lens covers !
__label__positive__ this camera was for my wife . she loves it ; particularly the grip portion as she 's had a stroke and her right arm is not as strong as it used to be .
__label__positive__ very nice and real easy to set up . just plug in and flow a couple steps and it is done and working . clear picture , easy to see from ipad and android phone .
__label__positive__ purchased for a friend 's d3200 , he loves it
__label__positive__ the lens is a good quality ..great colors rendering .. just remember that the aperture ring does not connect to the camera.. it could be a great entry level lens for a steady model with tripod .or exceptionally good with extension tube for macro work ... if to shoot in usual live situation , you probably will mostly use the fully open diaphragm . i decided to return because with my not perfect sight i will not get enough sharp shots to keep the lens.. i wished it had some kind of hook on the lens and a spring so we can manually close the diaphragm for some steps before pressing the shutter release. < br / > i feel sorry for the lens because the picture quality is very good ! ! !
__label__positive__ outstanding ! !
__label__positive__ very satisfied
__label__positive__ i loved the camera , its great thank you
__label__positive__ i gave this product four stars only because the color differs from the photo . it 's actually a bit brighter and less maroon . i read some reviews stating the strap falls off , but that would be due to a personal error , not an error in the straps design . i 've had absolutely no problems with it , and for the money , it 's a great value .
__label__negative__ well ... it records , but it a reddish color video . good enough for the price and size .
__label__negative__ we returned this , because our camera ( the same one pictured in the ad ) did not fit inside the bag . it seems like a nice , compact bag , but not usable for an olympus om-d e-m10 mirrorless digital camera .
__label__positive__ great piece , i hace my monitor attached to it , holds well , although about 20 minutes of straight hand held shooting in the jungle i had to tightend up again .
__label__positive__ very convenient to use with my cameras and tripod , nice quality .
__label__negative__ synergy digital substituted an expired off brand battery for the listed synergy battery listed with no resolution . beware ... you might not get what you purchased !
__label__positive__ i 'm having a lot of fun working with nd filters and this is a great , stackable , starter set .
__label__positive__ very strong clamp - no worries about the camera falling off when attached to a backpack strap . quick and easy to adjust . glad i did n't pay $ 60 for a fancy backpack clamp !
__label__positive__ excellent ! ! !
__label__positive__ very good adaptors
__label__positive__ good quality of metal and its perfect for my oly 14-50 mm ez ... ..manual/macro.it 's better than olympus not including a hood , stingy !
__label__positive__ perfect ! great product , great price , great delivery !
__label__negative__ the cord i received was vivitar branded and does not look like the one pictured . it is cheaply built , and it feels like the plastic locking ring will break with very little effort . i do n't like that it announces & # 34 ; vivitar & # 34 ; on the front of it . the one pictured does n't , which is part of the reason i chose to buy one from this seller . having said that , i can live with a brand name printed on it. < br / > < br / > what i ca n't live with is that every time i use it , i have to mount , unmount , remount the camera end several times , then mount and remount the flash on the other end until the pins decide to line up well enough . the shoes do not line up perfectly even half of the attempts i make . this makes the connection of the flash extremely unreliable . when they do line up , everything with my 430exii works just fine , but i ca n't be messing with this stuff in front of clients like that. < br / > < br / > i should have just bought the authentic canon cord .
__label__positive__ it 's awesome my fiancée loved it for her birthday gift
__label__negative__ [ [ asin : b00hv6kjp2 samsung wb50f 16.2mp smart wifi & nfc digital camera with 12x optical zoom and 3.0 & # 34 ; lcd ( red ) ] ] < br / > < br / > horrible camera . you get what you pay for . i am a pro photographer who every now and then likes a good quality point and shoot to take family snapshots and/or video without having to drag my pro gear along . i strayed from my usual product line ( canon ) hoping this would be a good replacement for the canon we lost . very disappointed in it 's performance . very slow focus . very poor quality images . i returned this unit and bought a canon ( sx610 hs ) and am very much happier i stayed with what i normally buy . you will be disappointed with the quality of this camera .
__label__neutral__ this is a good value , but what i would call a porno wide angle lens . its not incredibly wide , but its kinda funny because if you zoom in , so you do not see the black edges of the lens you get a kinda if its closer its bigger & if its farther its smaller . also kinda fixes the lens warp . so if you have the extra cash i would add it to your collection < br / > < br / > if you want a new lens to play with that is cheap , highly recommend < br / > < br / > the construction is solid , metal & glass , jsut make sure you understand your lens thread . if you do mess up just get a step up or a step down adapter .
__label__positive__ holds a charge for a long time .
__label__positive__ very sturdy plate . i 'm using it on a flycam nano to make it easier to remove my canon 70d . works great .
__label__positive__ i got one for my birthday and they are so cute and very easy to use . the only thing is before you take a picture make sure the setting is on correctly or the picture will be to dark or bright . i love this instant film camera ! !
__label__positive__ great camera for the price . we take it on vacation so we do n't have to use our phones .
__label__positive__ love these straps . so incredibly soft , and seemingly durable , and they are the perfect length . i appreciate the quality of fabric , of stitching , and that they arrived so fast . i have been bragging about my new camera straps to anyone who will listen ! i highly recommend the friendly swede .
__label__positive__ if you are using a sony a6000 , these will work ! this was my third purchase in an attempt to find lens pouches which will work for my a6000 lenses - and finally , this was the right one !
__label__positive__ love !
__label__positive__ batteries are rated at a higher level then the camera maker 's battery and at a fantastic price . they charge up and run just like the oem unit at less than 1/4 the price of a new canon batter . totally satisfied .
__label__positive__ poor quelity ... fair for the price .
__label__positive__ works great but sometimes freezes and has to be restarted - great value for money !
__label__positive__ great ! comes with everything you need & easy to use ! walter helped me with the entire set up , took less than 10 mins .
__label__negative__ broke the second day i bought , i was on a concert..
__label__positive__ amazing value for $ 50 and be careful , you will be hooked ! after about an hour of practice , you will be sending your little drone on spy missions to your neighbors . then you will buy more batteries..then you will buy a bigger drone
__label__positive__ high quality .
__label__positive__ great quality !
__label__positive__ what can i say , it 's worth the money .
__label__positive__ perfect fit
__label__negative__ cheap flimsy products , you get what you pay for .
__label__positive__ did what it was supposed to do : charged , held charge for a decent amount of time , charged in a reasonable amount of time . actually , to be fair , these did extremely well ... only needed to change them every two days or so for a camera that spent about 8 hours on or taking photos . these would easily charge overnight . made life easy .
__label__positive__ this is a great little action camera . it takes good pictures and the video is great . it is a little slow on the taking of the picture so if you are trying to get fast action shots like sports or fish it 's better to video it and cut the stills out of the video . the controls are easy to use . i have had it down to 25 feet in the ocean using the buttons and taking both pictures and video and it worked perfect . it has a slightly more narrow fov than the go pro so it does n't & # 34 ; fish eye & # 34 ; as bad out of the water . it also came with just about every mount and clip you would ever need for it and an extra back door .
__label__positive__ good camera . everything fine
__label__positive__ amazing bang for the buck . the legs alone are worth the price . very heavy duty , well made and although the head takes some getting used to , it is great for my needs . it 's not too heavy , but has enough weight to be solid .
__label__positive__ ths is a very well-made camera . the metal housing is lightweight yet very sturdy . the finish on the base metal is very nice and high quality.the color and contrast on this camera is very good . i would buy another one if the need arises .
__label__positive__ was delivered really fast & the product is great ! i broke my grips on my old rig , but these were a definite upgrade . i 'm building a new one and i 'm gon na purchase another set . i would definitely recommend this product !
__label__negative__ cameras are fine . but the display options on the monitor are exasperating . you can not display a particular image for more than 20 seconds - as it automatically defaults to the quad image . the uniden software team was more interested in trying to make useless options . should have kept my old uniden where you could leave it set on any selected image . even the 'scan ' feature only runs for 20 secs before defaulting to quad . bummer .
__label__positive__ great little case .
__label__positive__ the product works fantastic and does the job ! smooth movements once balance is achieved . it has different modes for panning and tilting that adds to the creativity im film -making.. < br / > < br / > the product is excellent but what stands out more is cambox/kamera tools exceptional service ( hee sung is the man ! ) < br / > < br / > when you are investing on an expensive piece of equipment more so on a newly develop product such as camera gimbal , one thing that i value the most is customer service . i personally would want someone to guide me through its use and would want a customer service back up when i need. < br / > the cambox owner , hee , will help answer all questions that you will need. < br / > < br / > he is an experienced videographer and is very technical and knowlegeable with all his products and the products out in the market ! < br / > < br / > purchase any one of his product and you will not be disappointed . i have 3 of his products.. and counting ! ! !
__label__negative__ this was not the lens strap described in the ad . the strap i received had a nikon logo on it and it was not woven cotton .
__label__positive__ k
__label__negative__ be very careful i ordered this and missed the return date by 1day . this item stop working with in the fist week of use ! ! ! ! only a 30 day return window !
__label__positive__ i have several sizes of this order and they all fit well into my plan .
__label__positive__ this is a very good camera . there are some shortcomings in the manual and software , but they are offset by the outstanding technical support . the first thing you notice is the camera case is made out of metal not plastic . the tail that hangs off the back of the camera has 4 connectors ( power in , ethernet in , audio in/out ) . the sd card slot is easily accessible under a screw cap on the top of the camera , and recording to the sd card works well . both the daytime and night time video are excellent , and there are different resolution settings depending on your quality preference . a note about the poe ( power over ethernet ) , it is finicky and requires just the right poe injector to work . if you plan to power the camera by poe only , email the microseven support for recommended poe injectors . the camera is adjusted using the included allen wrench to loosen and tighten the set screws , it would be nice if the manual included this information ( see more about the manual below ) . there is no built in microphone with this camera , if you want audio you need to purchase a mic and attach it to the audio connector . where things start to come off the rails a bit are the setup and user manual . what comes with the camera is a mini disc ( windows only ) for the setup software and a small piece of paper directing you to the website to download manuals/software and technical support . make sure to download both the setup and user manual from the website , you are going to need them . the setup and operating manual for the software program have a lot of good information , but some sections are not explained adequately . the manual was written by someone not native to the english language which also does n't help . the manual lacks a hardware section with a picture of the camera and a breakout of each of the camera 's components which seems unusual given there is quite a bit going on with the camera hardware . the software has a lot of functionality and works well , but does seem redundant and cluttered in some areas . it may require trial and error for you to decipher what is going on in some sections . but as mentioned a lot of options here , including recording 24/7 video to your sd card or computer along with automatic snapshot capture . there is a microseven android app for cell phone/tablet that is a breeze to setup . you simply enter your camera 's unique id along with the login/password and the camera feed is on your cell phone . this camera does not support ptz , but it would be nice if the microseven android app at least allowed you to enlarge the image like i am able to do using the tinycam android app . now we come to the technical support which is superb . there is good chance you may need email support because of the lack of guidance in some parts of the manuals . the technical support response is incredibly quick . i had several email questions that were returned with a response within 5 minutes , and one with a follow up phone call . as mentioned in other reviews jim c. seems to be the person who usually handles the technical support and is terrific to deal with . as mentioned this is a very good camera but requires time to learn the functions beyond basic monitoring . if you have setup a router or a basic home network you should be fine getting this camera up and running . if you have any problems then technical support is there to guide you .
__label__positive__ received product and tried installing it myself , that did n't work . called d-link customer service and received excellent assistance from employee id # ar004671
__label__positive__ works like a charm , parents super happy able to see old cassettes
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid : da325b1f5f2800743cc8ecd488b4a880 ] ] good protection and lightweight case for the phantom 2 , however , the transmitter space it a lot of odd . it seems the sticks are a little too snug and honestly i am not sure if i am even putting it in the right way ! ( a steak knife will fix that but still.. ) i do not have the vision , just the phantom 2 with the zenmuse gimbal . the phantom and gimbal have plenty of room and there is enough clearance at the back for the a/v transmitter to stick out 1/4 inch for clearance . lots of room for batteries ( 4 ) . the case requires you to remove the battery from the phantom ( unless you want to cram ) - but just recently i heard to remove your batteries when your not flying so that may be a good thing . i wish the side section was cut out a little bigger on the side to fit a 7 inch monitor , but there is room in the front pocket .
__label__neutral__ it slides over the camera but does n't lock in any way and seems like it could fall off at any moment . friction is the only thing holding it in place . i will post an update if it does n't help with flicker . appears to be a 3d printed item as you can see and feel the & # 34 ; bands & # 34 ; around the curves .
__label__neutral__ i should have purchased the product directly from manfotto or from a valid distributor of which amazon is not . there is no upc on the box that matches a list manfrotto gives you when trying to register the warranty even the one under the sticker that with a different barcode overlaying it . i was able to look one up using a search engine but i had to select a distributor on their list.. in addition i was uncertain to what the serial number was since it was no where to be found on the tripod itself . i saved 10 % and it does n't seem worth it to me .
__label__positive__ much cheaper than canon quality is the same orbetter
__label__positive__ at first my canary had some glitches and was frustrating to use but after they updated it a few times and i was able to make the wifi connection stronger my canary was working better then i ever could have wanted . the video is incredibly clear although it can always be better , and it is very reliable . the app is also very easy to use and i love the interface of it .
__label__positive__ works great , good value , fast shipper .
__label__neutral__ i ca n't complain too much given the price , but having purchased two of these now , i 'm disappointed by some of the quality issues in the camera , specifically with the sometimes sporadic reliability of the usb interface and the fact they both sometimes lose tract of their memory cards .
__label__positive__ superfast shipping . i love the camera .
__label__positive__ great resolution day & night ! i love works with q-see
__label__positive__ quite good for price !
__label__positive__ reasonably priced lens protection .
__label__positive__ i wish i bought this item sooner . great value .
__label__positive__ i absolutely love this fujikam ! got this to monitor newborn and house in general . it was so easy to install ( 5 minutes ) , and the iphone app is self explanatory . i can tilt , zoom , pan , use the 2 way mic to talk and listen , at night the infra red works great ( b & w at night , like a horror movie haha ) . really no bad surprise . picture quality is great ( varies with internet / wifi connectivity but they all do ) . only things that could have made this better 1 ) provide an sd card with the cam ( not included but needed if you want to record ) 2 ) offer an option with batteries rather than a power cord ( just so you can really place it anywhere without wires ) . but for the price ( half of a nestcam and no monthly fee etc ) this is amazing . i bought 2 and will probably get 1 or 2 more .
__label__positive__ fits my canon telephoto 75-250mm lens perfectly . it also fits my kit lens ( 18-55mm ) with minimal vignetting , very minimal . if you move away from your subject by one step you will make up for the loss distance of the vignette . great price , quality , and size .
__label__positive__ works great ! i 've used it on my dirtbike and a friends rzr . i read some reviews that people said they could n't get there batteries to charge . i did have trouble getting my batteries to charge the first time also but it was because the plug was n't in all the way . i thought it was and fought it for a good 30 min untill i got rough with it and & # 34 ; click & # 34 ; it started charging . so if your batteries wo n't charge push really hard on the connector its probably not in all the way .
__label__positive__ worked perfectly as described ! ! !
__label__positive__ great deal ! works great ! !
__label__negative__ as with many of the other reviews , i find that the grey card produces an overly warm balance under most lighting conditions . in addition , all three cards tend to produce significant glare under bright light .
__label__negative__ came used ! scratches all over the lens . returned asap .
__label__negative__ hard to attach and detach a lens .
__label__positive__ the product was amazing everything works perfectly nice and intact shipping was almost immediate !
__label__positive__ you ca n't beat the quality and price . easy to setup and use . used it during the replacement of our septic tank ( well , at least it was interesting ) and intend on using it during the construction of our new house . get familiar with the timer by using it a few times on mundane things like mowing the lawn or something before you use it on your project . once you 've got that down , you 'll know how to set your camera speed and duration .
__label__positive__ my canon powershot sx710 fits perfectly in this - with room for extra batteries . it is small enough that i can put it in my purse so my camera is with me all the time . it is a quality product .
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ amature photographer ... .it 's a lot of stuff for the price . if you purchase this stuff separately you 're going to pay 3x as much the flash is $ 60+ alone . i 'm having fun learning about all the different filter and playing with the lens . no problems with any of it .
__label__positive__ love it !
__label__positive__ works great ; timely and well padded shipping ; would buy again
__label__positive__ this bracket has so many other uses . one which has not been shown in the product images . i am using it with a canon vixia hf g20 . with all the hype of shooting video with dslr , there are only a few products manufactured for video cameras . this bracket fills that purpose and allows for additional accessories to be attached . i have ordered a shotgun microphone and led video light to attach to this bracket . if you notice , i have also attached a handle and quick release to offset the video camera . now i can replace the battery without taking the camera off the tripod and detaching the quick release plate . the handle and micro ball is from alzo video .
__label__positive__ love this flash . the camera store tried to sell me on a third party highly rated flash , but it did n't have a focusing light . this flash really rocks . great exposures .
__label__positive__ added this camera to my existing security system , excellent product !
__label__positive__ good deal
__label__positive__ great product , i use it on my seadoo spark .
__label__positive__ cant live without this case .
__label__positive__ well made , sturdy .
__label__positive__ i have a d5200 . this worked flawlessly directly out of the box !
__label__neutral__ no hard drive included , menu is clumsy , remote does not work well at all , and an inferior product to the last one i got . think8ng about just fixing my old one and ahooting this one .
__label__positive__ this is a great product and i am surprised there have not been more favorable reviews . there are enough different lenses here for what ever the project you might want to film . i was a little skeptical when i ordered it but am now totally convinced . this is definitely a good product and more than worth the money i paid for it . hoorah . richviers
__label__negative__ fake leather.screw not work on tripod
__label__positive__ this is my third drop cam , and i love them . set and forget . really easy and powerful. < br / > unfortunately , they were bought in 2014 by nest , and nest throttled back the bandwidth and now have introduced their own camera , which is n't near as good as the original drop cam . lots of problems with nest . no problems with drop cam .
__label__positive__ great
__label__negative__ it was a pretty nice camera with good image quality and features at first . but then , a subsequent foscam firmware upgrade crippled the ability to access the camera from a web browser . the camera now requires plugins to access it that are incompatible with any current version browser . connection fails even with compatibility mode enabled in ie11 . even foscam 's own desktop client software wo n't work with the camera . the tinycam android app and foscam 's own app both still work and prove the camera is working and online , but it 's not possible to completely configure the camera through either of those . foscam tech support did respond to my initial inquiry in a reasonable timeframe ( and confirmed their plugins were not currently working ) , but suggested using ie11 in compatibility mode , which does n't work . foscam support did not reply after i updated my ticket pointing this out . i would say there are too many options for wireless ip cameras to deal with headaches like this . btw- foscam support bot , please do n't reply to this review to update the firmware and ui to the latest version . it already is and that is precisely what broke browser support in the first place .
__label__positive__ arrived quickly and as described . no complaints
__label__positive__ extremely difficult to set up on a mac , and still can not get it to route through my verizon jetpack hotspot . sure this would be great on a pc with a wireless router , but i 'm not changing my computer system and wireless just for this. < br / > < br / > update : i added an internet service in addition to the jetpack and now have a wireless router . it still took a little time to set up , but now that it is up and working , the picture is crystal clear .
__label__neutral__ i 've only used it for 1 week . it has great potential but the rubber mirror clips melted in the indiana summer sun .
__label__positive__ this is exactly what i was looking for : a small , light weight wrap for my gopro . the quality is good , and the fit is perfect ! the orange color makes it easy to find in a backpack or camera bag .
__label__positive__ holder strap camera mount works wonderfully the base is made from metal the strap is sturdy and has storage built into the strap < br / > conviant for storing an extra camera battery and sd card < br / > < br / > my only complaint would be that there is n't storage on both parts of the shoulder cushion only on one part
__label__positive__ ok
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ lost the one that came with the camera . this worked like a charm and at a great price .
__label__positive__ i purchased this bundle ( rf-603n ( nikon ) + yn560iii ) to do off camera flash using my sony a7ii and sony s6000. < br / > i later purchased a rf-603c ( canon ) trigger to compare the 2 triggers . here is what i found : < br / > < br / > rf-603n < br / > - required me to solder in a 100kohm resistor to force tx mode . ( see youtube for instructions ) < br / > - not sure why , but it is a little smaller than the 603c < br / > - has a 2-position switch ( on/off ) < br / > - no way to lock down to the hot shoe. < br / > - has 4 pins on the bottom < br / > < br / > rf-603c < br / > - works out of the box - no solder in a resistor hack needed : - ) < br / > - has a 3-position switch ( off/tx/trx ) tx mode will remotely connect to the yn560iii and fire it. < br / > - has a screw-type locking system. < br / > - has 5 pins on the bottom ( one more than the 603n ) < br / > < br / > before you start jumping up and down. < br / > 1 . i also have a sony hlv-f20m flash which will not fire when mounted to either the 603c or the 603n ... ( on or off camera ) < br / > 2 . both units require a ground connection to the camera before they will work . so you must scratch off some paint from inside the hot shoe area . so you will also want to buy a & # 34 ; hot shoe cover for sony & # 34 ; ( also available here on amazon ) . < br / > 3 . even with the paint removed , you sometimes have to wiggle the rf-603 's around before they connect. < br / > < br / > bottom line - the 603c is a much better option for sony users. < br / > - does not require the resistor hack < br / > - i think the extra pin is a ground pin ( it seems to connect more often than the 603n ) < br / > - 603n and 603c can even talk with each other just fine to fire other flashes off camera ... just not my sony flash < br / > < br / > because it will not fire my sony flash , i could only give it 4 stars . maybe someday yongnuo will make a an rf-603s for sony .
__label__positive__ love it
__label__positive__ gud
__label__neutral__ nice size , average performance
__label__positive__ best camera backpark ever . there are compartments everywhere and the bag is extremely sturdy . this set the bar really high for what to expect from amazonbasics .
__label__positive__ all attachments fit and work well , wish case was a little larger to fit more in .
__label__neutral__ it 's ok. removable inner stuffing . essentially a nice hard case with foam insert that can be altered for need . only three stars because it is somewhat small and has limited storage . also , after removing the foam , the spaces loose rigidity , compared to a firmer foam. < br / > < br / > so , does the trick ... but soft foam causes some issue and size is a concern
__label__positive__ amazing product for the price .
__label__negative__ i bought this with the expectation that i am able to pan my camera for panoramic pictures . the problem is when the ball is locked into place , it also locks the panning mechanism below ! you ca n't rotate the damn thing . stupid design .
__label__neutral__ bought the camera was a good camera but after about 6 month the buttons on the side broke and can not be used
__label__positive__ i like it , easy to use , attaches to a tripod , light stand or a cold shoe , two batteries , a power adapter , recharger that recharges both batteries concurrently , and a good carrying case . i am not an expert in the exact tuning of the light temperature , we did see a some minor variances in our first usage , but corrected it visually with a white card using the temperature control knob ,
__label__positive__ great value . good for someone without smartphone or tablet .
__label__positive__ worked great on a big lab ! !
__label__positive__ we ’ ve been using our v15 for a few days and have been very pleased overall with the form and function of the camera . installation of the android app was simple and the configuration was virtually automatic ; the only technical knowledge needed was the ability for the user to connect to wi-fi and enter wi-fi network keys/passwords . setup was very easy and we were able to run the app on multiple phones , though only one can be signed in at a time… launching the app from one phone while another is viewing will disconnect the original viewer. < br / > < br / > the device itself is sleek and feels well-made . the base is weighty , likely for stability , but also makes the unit feel substantial and unlikely to be knocked over . i have not yet mounted it to a wall or ceiling but it ’ s not so heavy as to present an issue there. < br / > < br / > the operation of the motorized pan/tilt is smooth and fairly quiet . when controlling the camera the motorized sound of the camera panning around seems to get the attention of animals within ~10 feet but people in that radius didn ’ t appear to notice. < br / > < br / > the picture quality is quite good and the framerate is decent , though there ’ s naturally a bit of delay/lag time between what ’ s taking place real time versus what you see on the screen . the up to 8x digital zoom is functional but detail drops off considerably , though it ’ s still useful . panning around with the app is done through swipe gestures on the screen : swipe left to pan the image to the right , swipe down to tilt up , etc . might sound a bit counter-intuitive , but if you think of it as scrolling around a big photo on your phone then the operation makes sense . i do wish there was a way to make fine adjustments to the position/view through the app – the swipe will rotate the lens a few degrees but that translates to more than a few feet of field-of-view shift… good for looking around quickly but not great if you want to center the view on something or track something moving , such as a cat. < br / > < br / > sound quality is also good – i could make out the spoken dialogue in a tv show playing in the background and hear a conversation at normal volume between people in an otherwise quiet room . on the app you can also enable the camera ’ s built-in speaker and communicate with someone in the room. < br / > < br / > the low-light mode is pretty cool and does a good job of illuminating a dark room with near-infrared light – invisible to a person ( outside of a ring of glowing red leds around the lens ) but lights up the scene on your phone with a fairly detailed nightvision resolution. < br / > < br / > all in all , a great value for the price and the free one-day cloud storage is a nice bonus , though i have not used it yet . would definitely recommend this camera to anyone needing to remotely check in on your home and loved ones while away.r / > sound quality is also good – i could make out the spoken dialogue in a tv show playing in the background and hear a conversation at normal volume between people in an otherwise quiet room . on the app you can also enable the camera ’ s built-in speaker and communicate with someone in the room. < br / > < br / > the low-light mode is pretty cool and does a good job of illuminating a dark room with near-infrared light – invisible to a person ( outside of a ring of glowing red leds around the lens ) but lights up the scene on your phone with a fairly detailed nightvision resolution. < br / > < br / > all in all , a great value for the price and the free one-day cloud storage is a nice bonus , though i have not used it yet . would definitely recommend this camera to anyone needing to remotely check in on your home and loved ones while away .
__label__positive__ great as a web-accessible camera , not so good as a motion detector , especially at night when it detects phantoms . still , it 's a good supplement to my existing security system , at a very good price . set-up is easy though i was disconcerted by the bad english on the box and in the instructions .
__label__negative__ very soft until f5.6 defeats the purpose of a 2.8 lens ... it 's too bad a lens built so well ca n't take sharp pictures at large apertures ..
__label__positive__ excellent product !
__label__neutral__ what a really needed was a camera with an optical viewfinder , and this one does not have one . i take a ton of photos and i just ca n't hold it out an arm 's length for a long period of time . that being said , it does take good photos , but i have ordered another nikon ( the p7100 ) to replace this one , as it does have the optical viewfinder .
__label__positive__ very handy love it and thesse are allowed on any disney ride .
__label__positive__ i bought this little guy for my gopro . its definitely not & # 34 ; heavy duty & # 34 ; as the product description states but gets the job done . great little tripod for the price .
__label__positive__ good quality tape .
__label__positive__ received item very quickly ... ..its works great ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ best grip case available ! it feels amazing in hand while offering maximum protection ! and the manufacturer is small and local ! had the x20 grip in the past . wish they made grips for more cameras ! simply excellent .
__label__negative__ the hood does n't screw onto the lens in the right alignment . it sgihuld be able to be adjusted so that the longer flair is in a north south position and can be aligned that way . i 've trued many ways to align the hood but to no avail
__label__positive__ good quality and i like that it screws into the camera so there 's no chance of loosing the connection !
__label__neutral__ up until yesterday i was using the jpt3815w . yesterday i installed the jpt3815w-hd . i love the high definition – true color picture . but i ’ m having technical issues. < br / > < br / > my problem is that with the jpt3815w i was easily able to record video ( alarmed ) to a path on my hard drive . with the jpt3815w-hd under “ systems settings ” / “ alarm ” / “ action with alarm ” it only gives me the option of capturing & # 34 ; images & # 34 ; to email or to ftp . i want to capture & # 34 ; video & # 34 ; to the recording path on my computer – just like i was able to do with the jpt3815w. < br / > < br / > i am trying to get help from technical support for this issue . i this was not an issue , i would give it 5 stars ! if i get help that 's satisfactory , i will ammend this review. < br / > < br / > i am ammending this review : technical support did contact me promptly but the technical issue could not be fixed because the jpt3815w-hd does not carry the function that the jpt3815w had of recording video to a path of my choice on my computer . tech support admitted that this was an issue on their end in the design of the jpt3815w-hd and not on my end . i appreciate their candor. < br / > < br / > that said , i found that the best work around here was to simply activate the record icon on the desktop display screen and simply do continuous recording . this function does allow me to record to the path of my choice - the only difference is that it is recording continually , and not intermittendtly as i wanted it to do in alarm mode. < br / > < br / > because i like the other features so well , i went ahead an ordered a second identical camera tonight to use in a separate location at my residential property. < br / > < br / > because of the other features i like so well and because i found the work around for continuous recording ( still dissatisfied that it does n't record to the path of my choosing in alarm mode ) and because tech support from tenvis was honest and humble enough to admit the important feature that was not included in the upgrade model , i will go ahead and upgrade my review from 3 stars to 4 stars . hopefully tenvis will do something to fix this issue . it 's sad that this feature was not included in the hd model . if it was , i would give it 5 stars ! < br / > < br / > i am once again ammending this review . i first gave it 3 stars , then upgraded to 4 stars . sadly , i 'm downgrading it back to 3 stars . i bought the second jpt3815w-hd . it was my full expectation that this camera would support the multi-camera viewer using the computer desktop tenvis control panel ( 2 , 4 , or even 8 views on one screen ) . my older camera ( jpt3815w ) had this feature , so i expected the better hd camera to do the same . nope ! tech support said this : & # 34 ; our technnical saffs inform us camera will not support the mutil-viewer any more . very sorry. & # 34 ; i 'm sorry too ! come on tenvis - you can do better than this.y review from 3 stars to 4 stars . hopefully tenvis will do something to fix this issue . it 's sad that this feature was not included in the hd model . if it was , i would give it 5 stars ! i am once again ammending this review . i first gave it 3 stars , then upgraded to 4 stars . sadly , i 'm downgrading it back to 3 stars . i bought the second jpt3815w-hd . it was my full expectation that this camera would support the multi-camera viewer using the computer desktop tenvis control panel ( 2 , 4 , or even 8 views on one screen ) . my older camera ( jpt3815w ) had this feature , so i expected the better hd camera to do the same . nope ! tech support said this : & # 34 ; our technnical saffs inform us camera will not support the mutil-viewer any more . very sorry. & # 34 ; i 'm sorry too ! come on tenvis - you can do better than this .
__label__negative__ the listing for this item is very off. < br / > < br / > first its missing the heater and blower unit . it also provide a very blurry image and it does lack the privacy masking mode. < br / > < br / > i am awaiting for a reply from the vendor .
__label__negative__ worst quality camera i have even used/seen/owned in my life . they made better quality cameras for this 20 years ago . even worse , when i bought this it was $ 85 . i bought this to make youtube makeup tutorials and i wish i would have saved my money or known i could return it . this is the worst quality and absolutely impossible to make videos with any level of decent quality . save your money and buy something better quality . i would give this negative stars if i could but , then again , i spent much more than it costs now .
__label__positive__ god
__label__positive__ it is so nice to have a machine to take our old slides and negatives and make them digital ! nice quality .
__label__positive__ takes great pictures , something i was looking for in a small camera . perfect for what i bought it for .
__label__positive__ product was received in a timely fashion . very reliable
__label__negative__ worst web cam i have ever tried and the worst customer service
__label__neutral__ the camera case if well built but is a little small for the camera i purchased it for . i will certainly find another use for it though . great value .
__label__positive__ works great cheap price
__label__positive__ i bought this camera for my wife and she is happy with it . it has a good zoom , but it has to have to compete with other cameras in its class . it 's a good point and shoot camera and it takes good pictures .
__label__positive__ great camera and the pictures come out awesome .
__label__positive__ bought this kit for my brother so that he would have an extra battery . he was very excited about the mini tripod and ability to charge the battery in his truck . this kit is a super value and quality product .
__label__positive__ purchased for my wife as an extra safety when she has to walk to her car in the dark after she gets off work . a quick test showed it is good and loud - and will be one more thing to make here feel safer .
__label__positive__ i like the coolpix cameras . easy to use .
__label__positive__ very fast delivery .. it 's my husbands 60 th birthday present . he has n't seen yet but i 'm sure he will be thrilled .
__label__negative__ i bought these after receiving a & # 34 ; terroristic threat & # 34 ; on my bicycle last week . people around here do n't know how to drive around bikes. < br / > < br / > first of all - the video is not & # 34 ; 720 & # 34 ; . it 's 720x480 , which if speaking in geek vernacular ( i 'm an i.t . guy who does work in a recording studio ) , this would be referred to as 480 under normal geek/video speak , or sd . 720 is considered entry level hd , which this certainly is not. < br / > < br / > there is a time and date stamp imposed on the video - there is no way that i can see to actually set a clock - the stamp is completely arbitrary. < br / > < br / > the video was reasonable for the price , the camera was slow to respond to light changes and the audio picked up mega amounts of wind noise. < br / > the aim was a bit high on the camera , not a horrible thing , but i could see it being problematic if your purpose was to record an up-close conversation. < br / > < br / > i used it about four times before it quit working all together , i 'm guessing sweat killed it . i have n't done an autopsy , i may consider it , but wednesday i turned it on , started recording and by the time i got home the indicators were off . i tried charging it , never another light l.e.d. < br / > < br / > if you want disposable dvr glasses , these could be for you . if you want a toy for your kid , these could be for you . if you want a serious sports camera , an evidence gathering spy device , or something you want to work a week or two after you buy them , shop somewhere else .
__label__positive__ i like this grip . it seems very secure . for diving , however , i recommend using a longer arm so you do n't put your hand too close to animals that may bite .
__label__positive__ i absolutely love the item ! it is portable so i can carry it anywhere but the only thing is that it has short lasting batteries . but what can we do about that..
__label__negative__ no good n o good takes to long
__label__positive__ what a wonderful case for the price ! fits my canon elph 340 hs perfectly . no complaints whatsoever .
__label__negative__ terrible , came with a bolt that was too short , do completely unusable . more importantly , it wasted my time because i had to find an alternative + return this poorly kitted product .
__label__negative__ short life time .
__label__positive__ aaa+++ would buy from this supplier without hesitation ! ! !
__label__positive__ this battery charger is as advertised . it replaces one that i had lost . works fine .
__label__positive__ made of metal so it 's more resilient and can hold up to a lot of use . threads seem to line up nicely and go on without a fight .
__label__negative__ this is watch hugely bulky on my wrists . i have a smaller bone structure and find this watch somewhat uncomfortable because of its size . the user interface is hard to navigate and i continually press the wrong button to chart my runs . this is the first running watch i have bought , so i can not compare to other brands . however , i wish i would have saved my money ( even though this was a very affordable model ) and bought a more upgraded watch . not a horrible watch , but definitely not one of the best on the market .
__label__positive__ love the drone . get the version with the skytroller ! you 'll wish you did and it 's expensive to purchase later .
__label__positive__ a great little puller ! as expected , a small amount of tweaking was required to get it just the way i like . adjustable everything ; unit angle , gear lash , reversible design . it can even be fitted on a rig setup with inverted ( from the top , not bottom ) rods. < br / > < br / > one design modification i 've had to make ; a ratcheting nut instead of fixed as supplied . huge improvement .
__label__positive__ my husband love it
__label__neutral__ all the leds do not light up at night . it has one flashing red one the one that was shipped to me . i did take it into a completely dark foom for 10 minutes to see if the other leds come on but they do not . however , for $ 7 bucks it looks good .
__label__positive__ works great just what we need for our shop
__label__positive__ the product is good condition , no problem
__label__positive__ it 's worth every penny . beautiful , stable , smooth turning and locks down tight . definitely worth the money .
__label__positive__ great little bag , ideal to carry on your hip if your camera fits it ( my olympus stylus 1s fits with room to spare . very handy memory card pocket in lid and two surprisingly large side pockets . nice looking with red interior . dirt cheap . i returned a $ 35 tamrac bag when i saw this .
__label__negative__ i purchased this bad boy about one month ago . ordered 65watt ( actual energy used ) fluorescent light bulbs for it . it was very bright and worked great . after i month i came to the shop and a breaker had been tripped . this light would n't work so i checked the fuse sure enough it had burnt out . i ordered fuses from amazon as they are small and the local radio shack is closed down that was by my house . after putting a new fuse and turning it on one of the light bulbs started to smoke pretty bad . i unscrewed that light bulb and attempted to turn it on again . flick flicker flicker another light bulb goes out without the smoke . now one light socket works and i am waiting until next week when my trash can is empty again to throw it away. < br / > great product if you only need to use it a few times otherwise buy something else .
__label__positive__ ordered this for my nikon d750 . the documentation is good and the product works perfectly . i 'm very happy with this purchase !
__label__positive__ awesome case , everything fits well
__label__negative__ nikon does not recommend . suggested using them could possibly void warranty . returned for refund .
__label__neutral__ works fine i like it
__label__positive__ i bought this product to help me work on smd on pcb . the image is clear and i can zoom in to see the components . however , there are two design issues . first , to settle the focusing is a bit hard . this is due the base plastic sheet base is not heavy . the second issue is the video update rate is slow so working with the component through the microscope is not easy . i hope the vendor can produce a model with higher update rate and stable base even the price is higher .
__label__negative__ the product works well but with only 40 minutes of video i was disappointed . i was trying to catch someone in the act of stealing but the 40 minutes of video ( as opposed to the stated 2 hrs . ) was not working form me . i sent an email to customer service and received the following reply ... . < br / > & # 34 ; so sorry for the late reply as i have been on small holiday . the battery life improves over time it will be at its max after you have charged it 8 times , sorry this is just the way lithium ion battery 's work . try and recharge and use for 8 times and see if the battery life improves , if it still wo n't improve there is a problem and we will send you another . please let me know how you go . - scott & # 34 ; < br / > this sounded very fishy to me but i took his advise and ... ( drum roll please ) ... the battery life actually dropped from 40 minutes to 30 minutes . so i sent another email stating the results and asking for another unit and no reply back what so ever . perhaps i had a defective unit , but based on the zero reply from customer service for a replacement i 'm kind of doubting that . good quality but the 30 minutes is a deal breaker for me .
__label__positive__ good
__label__positive__ i bought this digital frame during a trip to the united states and kept it stored for a long time without even test it . taking advantage of a break this weekend , i decided to finally install it . what a surprise ! good image , good cost-benefit . and , yes , it motion-function works amazingly well .
__label__positive__ so far it 's done what i needed to do thank you
__label__positive__ works as advertised . charges quite rapidly .
__label__positive__ great little camera to mount on the bottom of a rc airplane ! tons of fun ! wonderfully clear pictures..this replaces the one i misplaced , it has a lot of potential to have fun with , especially on an electric plane , zero engine noise to attract attention .
__label__positive__ i could n't be happier as this hand grip is solid , tight and fits like a glove . for the price it 's a real bargain . the hole for the battery removal is great as well . i removed the end & # 34 ; c & # 34 ; bracket since i would n't use it . basically once installed you should n't have to remove it . i 'm telling you once cinched down there is absolutely no movement at all . really well machined . since the grip portion is smooth i plan on painting it with a plastic grip spray for even a firmer grip . for a $ 100 less than what fujifilm wanted for theirs i 'm so happy i found and tried this one . plus there 's the added benefit on not wearing out the grip on the front of the camera as well . with the lensmate for the back and this for the front , i 'm all set . too bad the lensmate was n't $ 29 .
__label__positive__ excellent , very please
__label__positive__ had a nikon coolpix camera from 2004 which is still working great but the charger was damaged . very happy to see the charger working again .

__label__positive__ how many have a cabinet , bin , or bucket full of batteries and the chargers needed for each individual type of battery ? the bc-3000 by ambient weather can help clean the clutter. < br / > this thing can charge , recharge , refresh , and test aaaa , aaa , aa , a , c , subc , d ( with optional adapter ) nimh/nicd batteries < br / > and what i found personally helpful is that it can also handle li-ion batteries : 10440 , 14500 , 14650 , lir123a or rcr123a ( 17340 ) , 17500 , 17670 , 18350 , 18500 , 18650 , 19670 ( protected 18650 ) , 25500 , 26500 , 26650 < br / > i was able to start using this right out of the box , really no major learning curve . but reading the short instructions did clue me in to a few things that helped me use it more productively . of course as soon as i opened it i went and found a few different battery types in stuck them all in ( see photo ) . immediately the lcd display registered all of them and started the individual charging process for each battery in the bay . how cool that you can possibly have 4 different types of batteries in each bay and they are all independent of one another . as one battery displayed “ full ” i would swap in another one while others were charging and the unit just picked right up and started that one. < br / > another cool thing is that you can have each bay manually set to whatever it is you need for that battery ( ie : charge/discharge/test modes ect.. ) or you can have them all set to do the same thing. < br / > the lcd is a bit dark but readable under normal reading conditions ( see photo ) . there is a back light to it that you can turn on temporarily or permanently . this unit also has a fan . in a quiet room you can hear it ; it is not overbearing and only comes on when unit is getting too hot. < br / > i do have a very similar older unit to this one from a different manufacturer and i have to say this one is far better in comparison when matching apples to apples . with this unit alone it replaces three other battery chargers i have had . you also get a 3 yr warranty thatalone is worth it . ambient weather keeps on turning out great new products , ( i would not be surprised to find that the next revision of this battery charger will recharge your car battery ; - )
__label__positive__ love it
__label__negative__ hardware : < br / > < br / > meh . not as good as their previous model ( the a rev of the dcs-5222l ) , at least in my opinion . the pan and tilt motors are much louder and come across on video very loud . not sure if this is more of a far too sensitive microphone or what. < br / > < br / > the other issue is that the user 's list , once populated , user 's can not control the camera . defeats the purpose of a pan , tilt , zoom camera if you can not allow the users to login and control it ... control panel is completely missing from the live video screen once logged in as a user. < br / > < br / > in all honesty , do n't expect to receive much help from their customer service via email . ca n't get a peep out of them since june 15 . if you 're out there dlink , look up case id : c6691037 < br / > < br / > i 'll change my review when you correct your customer service .
__label__positive__ these batteries have lasted well . they hold a charge without a problem and do not drain quickly while in storage . they take as many shots or more than my original canon batteries , but at a much cheaper price . they charge fine in the states and in various countries around europe .
__label__positive__ ordered one of these for my wife 's nikon p510 ... and i thought for $ 6+ just how good could it be ? these are really a quality item and i do n't know how they produce them for that price . so now that i have seen hers , i have ordered two more for my own cameras . looks to be very comfortable as others have stated and as i said , it looks like it will last a long time . looking forward to using my two straps !
__label__negative__ please email me better instructions < br / > joeykhafi @ me.com
__label__positive__ very good price and works great
__label__positive__ the perfect camera that fits like a & # 34 ; tool in your hand & # 34 ; toe carry and snap pickup'tures asserting your rights !
__label__positive__ well build and hold everything you need . gets heavy with my laptop packed and all camera gear but straps and harnesses seem fine .
__label__positive__ this picture is the reason i bought this lens ... no words to say , the picture speaks by itself ... taken at new orleans aquarium
__label__positive__ works great . had issues of kids ringing doorbell and running . so far it works great , but no kids ringing doorbell yet .
__label__positive__ very nice . worth the money
__label__positive__ purchased several of these to help 'protect ' an empty home and the home we live in . easy to place and secure and when placed up high ( as they should be ) and look real enough that so far everyone has thought they were real . we also purchased window stickers that say the property is under video surveillance .
__label__positive__ i like that the cord has an adjustment button . other camera floats are sort of one size . works well for it 's purpose .
__label__positive__ instructions say you need to open up your dji and do some surgery . you do not need to open up the device and tap into the battery . i just ordered this battery ( http : //smile.amazon.com/gp/product/b00m7m4dz2 ? refrid=00b33ce48hcxesf0kdqp & ref_=pd_bia_nav_t_1 ) ( which fit perfect ) for the device and just used velcro to pin the battery onto the drone . as you can see when i pan left and right , the image does n't shake and the video stays still . ( pardon the blur in the middle of the screen . i scratched my gopro lens and am in the process of getting a replacement lens . ) https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=yivvhj9ufue
__label__positive__ very good
__label__positive__ you need to know some things about setting up electronic/computer/phone app stuff to get this to do what it advertises it will do ... took me about 1 1/2 hours to get the cameras/monitor base/computer/phone all worky . tried loading & operating software on my 64 bit windows 7 rig -- not ... tried again on my windows 7 32 bit system ( as directed by uniden ) netbook -- perfect . i can now monitor my house front & rear from my phone ... update 10/17 -- have since upgraded my netbook to windows 10 , which did not affect the uniden software in any way . also purchased a third camera , which was simple to add to the system - now i also peek in on my dog snoozing on the living room sofa while i 'm at work ... shall be maxing the system out with camera 4 soon .
__label__positive__ great products and fantastic merchants .
__label__positive__ we have been using this battery as a backup and it 's in the camera now < br / > ca n't confirm life or hours before a new charge but it appears to be as good as the original battery
__label__positive__ the box had been opened . items were missing from the box which are being replaced by sony after my phone call . the camera was sold to me as a new item although it should have been sold to me as a used item . the camera itself is well built and appears to be a winner . after several strolls around the menus , it is clear that the menus were not developed by anyone who is a photographer . the menus are logical although contrary to what one normally encounters . they make sense once you spend some & # 34 ; quality time & # 34 ; playing with the camera . the camera is light weight and easy to carry and use . the controls on the rear of digital cameras have always been problematic for me . typically , i accidentally hit these buttons while shooting and have to spend time disengaging the functions i have accidentally set off . sony has averted this by allowing you the option of not assigning functions to the buttons and controls . wow ! this is great . also , the sony rx1 sees in the dark in comparison to other cameras . it is a low light shooter . the raw files are huge and and my poor macbook pro keeps freezing and choking . i have learned that the mac buffers fill up quickly and i empty them inelegantly by restarting the computer.this works and the flow of image processing goes forward if i allow the computer to reboot after having processed a series of files . i have a fuji x100s aps-c camera which is a wonderful camera which does most of what the rx1 does . the image quality is very comparable to the rx1r in average shooting conditions . the rx1r and the x100s are of similar construction , handling , and image quality . however , if want to shoot decent images in near darkness with high isos , the sony is the clear winner . if you are an ocd personality , as i am , the sony rx1r will make you smile . just be prepared for the headaches associated with dealing with such large image files . my processing programs , adobe acr , iridient raw converter , etc . operate slowly and require regular reboots . my two cents with , , ,
__label__positive__ my 13 year old granddaughter loves it !
__label__neutral__ awkward to use .
__label__positive__ good camera , good price . happy with purchase .
__label__negative__ turned on for a moment and stopped working
__label__positive__ i received this product as a gift for my birthday , i loved it ! definitely i will purchase again from prime pro !
__label__positive__ vary good i liked it vary
__label__positive__ good quality film , and it lasted me a long time .
__label__positive__ works great , just as advertised .
__label__positive__ this is a great little camera . if you 're looking for a device that comes with lengthly literature and user manuals , this is not the camera for you . however , if you 're willing to sacrifice the manuals for the most amazing customer service and a product that actually works as advertised , this is the product for you . we were having an issue with our anti-virus software conflicting with the camera and jim had us up and running at 7pm on a friday night . the camera 's wifi is much better than expected and the picture quality is outstanding. < br / > < br / > we researched several camera systems and are so glad we chose this one . we 'll be adding more cameras in the near future .
__label__positive__ you get what you paid for . items are not super premium but ok as they 're not expensive , the straps for head and chest are totally worth it .
__label__positive__ worked great snorkeling . so easy to hold and held help in big waves
__label__negative__ so annoying ! ! ! .not good photo quality . buttons are hard to press .
__label__positive__ really good ... more than expected ...
__label__positive__ at $ 29,95 , this may be one of the best values around ! i bought this bag for my mirrorless camera and accessories . this bag is more than big enough for the camera and all of its peripherals . my first impression when i received it was & # 34 ; wow ! & # 34 ; , it is much bigger than i had expected . it also appears to be very well made ; the stitching is tight and even and the shoulder strap has a really comfortable adjustable pad on it which is very well thought out because it can be moved along the strap so it is comfortable however you carry it . the strap is also long enough that you can sling it across your chest for comfort and added security . all buckles and rings are metal and very sturdy . the top flap has internal and external zippered pockets and all zippers are very substantial and smooth operating . the top closure on the bag itself is very well thought out . it is a full width heavy duty double zipper that is attached to the bases of the shoulder strap and when the bag is being carried , pulls the opening shut . the main compartment is spacious and reasonably well padded and one suggestion i would make for improvement , would be to cover a larger area of the compartment with the fuzzy side of the velcro to give you a little more choice as to how you place the dividers . the bag is also equipped with a water proof nylon rain cover that stows away in a zippered compartment in the rear of the bag . all in all this is an exceptional value in terms of & # 34 ; bang for your buck & # 34 ; and i definitely recommend it .
__label__positive__ if you 're going to have a several hundred , if not thousand dollar camera , be smart . buy a uv filter and protect your lens ' . $ 8 to save $ 300- $ 2000 lens is easy math .
__label__positive__ as advertised , protects my new lens . satisfied customer .
__label__negative__ i received it today , amazon delivery is amazing < br / > but the product is no good < br / > - does not mount to my car at all , my rear view mirror is too big for the clamp < br / > - the device does not recognize my sandisk class 10 sd
__label__positive__ 1 . audio - has a lot of fuzzy/crackly noise during playback ( recorded in hd ) . 2 . viewing coverage - narrow lens angle , but the quality of the hd video is good . 3 . phone app - i like the alerts ( you can customize them ) . do n't think you can view previous film from the app but i might be wrong . 4 . camera heat - gets hot to the touch . i will be monitoring this closely . 5 . bandwidth - not good . on hd recording it used 3mbps download / 0.6mbps upload . what happens if you add multiple cameras ? 6 . wall mount - not so great . 7 . connection option - no ethernet option . not a big deal , but it would be nice . 6 . installation - very easy - it 's only saving grace , extremely easy and took less than five minutes . literally . 7 . cloud storage - the one day of free storage is nice . prices are reasonable .
__label__positive__ works great < br / > ar004273 < br / > case # c6702606
__label__negative__ poor quality
__label__negative__ only works less than half the time . so frustrating , i wanted to throw it away . shame on you gopro for selling such a bogus item
__label__positive__ all the reviews say this is cheap but i love it it 's sturdy enough for my full size 42 & # 34 ; reflector and it works well ! my only complaint is it 's did n't come with instructions so took me a sec to figure out how to assemble it but it 's pretty self explanatory once you look at the photo again .
__label__positive__ amazing amount of connections .
__label__positive__ great item . i 've used it for a while and had great video taken from this thing !
__label__negative__ i bought it for no reason this crap did not even fit my tripod and did not fit my gopro3
__label__positive__ great camera , fast shipping
__label__positive__ have you ever come across a device that you do n't think you need but then actually use it and realize you ca n't live without it ? the acadia selfie stick is one of those handy devices. < br / > < br / > i had some friends over this weekend and we played with this and loved it . they took a lot of really nice group shots and & # 34 ; fun & # 34 ; photos for their fb pages . when they left , i took a few boudoir shots of myself for my fb page. < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > 1 . easy to setup - it was very easy to pair this to my phone. < br / > < br / > 2 . easy to use - getting good self-shots with this device is as simple as pressing a button. < br / > < br / > 3 . good range - the selfie stick extends to 33 inches making it great for otherwise hard to take group shots. < br / > < br / > 4 . sturdy - the selfie stick has a heavy duty feel to it . it feels sturdy even when it is fully extended. < br / > < br / > 5 . good grip on my phone - the clamp holds my phone nice and tight . i had no worries about the phone coming loose and falling to the ground. < br / > < br / > 6 . portability - the cradle can be flipped down and when the pole is fully collapsed , the device is about 8 inches long . it is small enough to toss in a bag and carry around. < br / > < br / > cons : none < br / > < br / > i was n't a big selfie taker before i had this device but now that i have it i ’ m taking quality erotic self-shots and i ’ m having fun doing it. < br / > < br / > * i received this free sample in exchange for my unbiased review .
__label__positive__ used a couple of times . nices because you can put one each vehicle even though there meant for different sized lenses it works good for sunglasses , binos , scopes , etc .
__label__positive__ we 're enjoying the learning curve with this stabilizer and improving with practice . the tips help .
__label__positive__ fits like a charm . exactly what i needed when mine fell off my canon xsi .
__label__positive__ i have been searching for a product that will convert slides from my tour of duty in vietnam to a photo that i can store in the computer . i did have over 200 such slides ; many were no longer legible because of storage in a closet . the wolverine converted the remaining 40 slides for me very well . i am more than satisfied with this product .
__label__positive__ i was looking for something similar to the gopro , and found this one very competitive price and very good reviews so i wanted to give a try without having to invest a lot of money in a gopro , as i do n't do much radical things ... i wanted a waterproof camera and i love the feature that i use the app to control it . so i took it to the beach to take pictures and record my kids and can not complain ! has a good quality ! also i took for our zipline adventure where my son placed ut on top of his helmet and i controlled through my phone ! was a very fun experience ! ! ! hope the review helps !
__label__positive__ great for a second battery for my phone . i use my phone often and it does wear out the battery power , so i bought a second battery and now always have one charged and ready to go ! charges very quickly . love it . travels easily .
__label__positive__ seems like a very sturdy little unit , everything works well . minus two stars for confusing instructions but plus one for attempts at customers service such as helpful video and replies to questions that i and other customers have had . the concept is simple ( but it still took a few tries to get it right ) , you connect to the camera 's wifi with your phone then tell the camera via your phone to connect to your wifi router . it 's been connected for a few weeks straight . night vision works good to about 6ft and fades out after about 10-12ft . it 's not a 180 degree light ; it 's more focused like maybe 45 degrees . i 'd like to find an additional ir light to supplement . the motion sensor recording works well . i can also take snapshots or recordings manually with my phone of computer . there seems to be much more functionality with the computer app . the disc it came on did n't have a working copy , but the seller posted the link to the correct software in the q & a section . it is in the 24-hr format and there 's no alarm feature .
__label__positive__ great purchase
__label__positive__ after going through 3 other t-mounts i bought from china i finally found one that connects tightly on my sony a37 .
__label__positive__ love all the compartments in this bag . i try to carry my camera and three lenses and a flash but unforutnately it 's too much . probably big enough for a camera , 1 lens and a flash . wish i had gotten a bigger size but thats my fault . the construction of this bag is top notch though !
__label__positive__ this item was exactly what i needed and came right on time . it arrived the day before my trip , which could n't have been more perfect. < br / > < br / > -td < br / > these are the last days of dark .
__label__negative__ my nikon 3200 wo n't read these batteries .
__label__negative__ sent them back . for some reason i could n't see out of them .
__label__neutral__ my camera did not fit on the tripod and it was a instax camera !
__label__negative__ i does what it is advertised for , however only while stationary . on my bicycle it is not stable/rigid enough and shakes continously . since it is designed for an & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; camera , i would like to be able to use it while in motion and that ai n't my bike , even during a casual cruise .
__label__positive__ great one ! should buy
__label__positive__ it was easy to assemble and it works great
__label__positive__ i give this camera 5 stars based on how good the videos look , as compared to what you pay for the camera . i compared this to the 200.00 dollar ( at the time ) sony as15 , and this was actually better , which was both astounding , and sad to me. < br / > < br / > auto white balance and color rendition : < br / > i found the color reproduction in this camera to be excellent ! especially for the price ! there generally are few errors in auto white balance , with the exception of coming out of heavy back lighting. < br / > < br / > video detail : < br / > video detail is actually great ! it is amazing that this camera that is so cheap can do such a suitable job of creating a video without major compression artifacts apparent , that ends up having great detail . it does n't compare to my gopros , but if you are looking for something cheap for video only , this is a good choice ! < br / > < br / > still photos : < br / > i really would n't bother with these . photo stills from this camera are generally very poor , with flat highlights , and few details . i guess okay if you want a record of events , but nothing people would enjoy viewing.. < br / > < br / > sound quality : < br / > nothing you would probably find useable , except as i said as a record . it is muffled , and not very good. < br / > < br / > summary : < br / > for the money , and excellent camera to mount on a drone ... as i said , it does n't compare to my gopros , but would you expect it to at this cost ? < br / > < br / > example video : < br / > https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=vo2iwbitedc
__label__positive__ exactly what i was looking for ! you 'd be amazed how hard it is to find these things anywhere !
__label__neutral__ good quality but ca n't use the protective lens cover on it .
__label__positive__ i 'm very satisfied so far . the roxant feels solid and i can trust it not to break down in a crucial moment. < br / > < br / > within this price range , it is a really good product .
__label__positive__ this has become my favorite lens , i use it for almost everything . besides the usual macro close ups , we 've used it for portraits , images of our dog in the park , images of whales off a pier , even just a general walkaround lens . if you are considering buying this lens , do it ! it is so much fun to use , and the image quality is unparalleled .
__label__negative__ it clamped this to my camera bag and the rotating ball part fell off ! i did n't even have a chance to use it .
__label__positive__ i was n't expecting a lot from a $ 20 tripod , i just needed something a little bulkier to hold my t5i . this totally blew me away when i first took it out of the box , it 's so sturdy i do n't think it would even tip over in the wind . it 's easy to adjust the legs and the little part on the top keeps my camera locked into place so i never have to worry about it falling off . if you were to buy something similar at a store , it wold cost you at least $ 50 . i would recommend this to anyone that needs a high quality tripod , on a budget .
__label__neutral__ takes good pictures , but i have had a occasional isssues with it turning on and the zoom lenses going all the way open and making a click click click sound followed by a screen display of & # 34 ; lens error & # 34 ; . < br / > < br / > the only remedy is to pop the battery out and then it seems to go back to normal . i do like the capabilities of this device , the zoom is really really good , the video quality great and even stereo sound ... but it does have a few little annoying flaws that can inhibit use .
__label__positive__ batteries both came fully charged and ready to use . i used the camera for over an hour and the battery still had plenty of juice left . charged up quickly . would buy more of these if i need them .
__label__positive__ works perfectly .
__label__positive__ pros : < br / > i have n't owned any of the sub- $ 100 shoulder rigs so i ca n't compare build quality directly , but with a background in engineering/manufacturing i can say that i feel the quality of this rig is very good. < br / > < br / > the dimensions are all standard ( 15mm diameter rails spaced 60mm apart ) so most accessories should fit . i purchased a smallrig top handle and mounting block that fit great . my fotga dp500 2s attaches easily and securely . i purchased a manfrotto 577 quick release base and it attaches securely to the sr-1500 camera mount ( which has holes for both 3/8 and 1/4 screws ) . < br / > < br / > the shoulder pad is a sturdy rubber that is firm but comfortable . the shell of the shoulder pad has both a 1/4 and a 3/8 screw hole , to which i attached a quick release plate so that the rig could be thrown onto a tripod . while this shell is plastic i have confidence that those mounts will hold. < br / > < br / > my copy had all black hardware , which i prefer to the orange in the photo. < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > the foam rubber on the handles will likely squish and scrunch overtime and need to be replaced . however , the end caps on the handles screw off so new grips can be installed easily. < br / > < br / > the screws that attach the crossbars ( bars to which the handles attach ) to the block are m3x10mm . while they 're installed with thread-lock and the crossbar rods are slotted to prevent rotation , these small screws and the bit of clearance between the bars and block means there 's some wiggle , especially with the long handles creating such large torque . i was able to fix this by installing toothed lock washers ( see photo ) and putting a small piece of steel shim in the slot between the bars and the block to remove the clearance .
__label__positive__ great camera ! stunning ! easy to work with .
__label__negative__ i have owned this flash for just over two months . it is a wonderful , and powerful flash when it worked properly . i am not sure what the issue is , but after a few uses , the i-ttl stopped working and it only fires at full power in manual mode . i can set it to fire at 1/128 power , but the picture will come out looking exactly the same as 1/1 power . i have googled the issue , and this seems to be a fairly common issue . i wish i would have known how common this issue was before buying . i had n't used this flash often ( maybe 100 actual flashes ) so i did n't notice the issue until i am past the point of return . i assume i could ship it to china for a replacement , but that will cost more money. < br / > < br / > i have attached a few sample pics . the first is trying to use i-ttl . second is 1/1 power , third is 1/128 power . all 3 were taken with a nikon d5300 in manual mode with a shutter speed of 1/60 , aperture of f/22 and iso 100 .
__label__positive__ got this amcrest 720p system after neighbor was burglarized . out of the box , which is packed and padded very well , noticed there was no 'how-to ' guide . to amcrest.com and download one . equipment was installed with cameras on high soffit 's , run thru attic , then down inside wall to computer room . vga to pc monitor , and hdmi thru attic , down inside wall to liv . rm.tv . toggling between hdmi inputs on the sony lets me see security cams from the comfort of recliner . of all features , i like remote viewing the most . from any pc , my laptop , nexus , and samsung s5 smartphone with the amcrest lite app ( p2p ) . i must add that my at & t router was a bit problematic , but the great cs reps at amcrest were able to get me up and running . this simple explanation does not convey the level of complexity and expertise that was involved in getting my system to perfection . they were awesome and my system is awesome . word of advice ... something i read in some reviews ... if you want 4 cams , get the larger system with 8 cams . you will find a use . how about a cam aimed at your a/c condenser , in case you are in an area that they steal them . or that expensive bbq grill . forgot one important thing ... must do the firmware update on the dvr to the latest version ... as of today that was may 2015 .
__label__positive__ this review will cover the item and the seller . the seller , tvyybox , shipped the item to me fast and therefore i have to say all was good there. < br / > < br / > the item itself , while a great value , does have a few drawbacks . before we get to drawbacks , lets start with the basics . the primary feature , waterproofing , worked flawlessly in a 1 hour test in my kitchen sink . will it hold up at up to 40m ? i have no idea , but it is a good start it works great at 0.5m . it fits the camera well . i did not use the 14-42 lens that is was made for , instead i used the 9-18 lens . i can not get the full range on that lens , but then again , i never expected to since it was never rated for it . forget about the 14-150 , no chance there . again , this is just fyi , it was not designed for these lenses. < br / > < br / > the drawbacks : < br / > 1 ) it does not allow the omd em10 popup flash to function . the flash will pop up , but it will pop up just slightly shy of how much it needs to to register it is up . all of the allowances they made for flash were pointless without the proper clearance . -1 point for that. < br / > < br / > 2 ) the water detection module is really cheap . i will not deduct points , but it really is a rather basic junk that may not be reliable . not even sure if you can change the battery on it. < br / > < br / > actually , just those 2 drawbacks . you 'll need to toggle the evf/lvf to button only so that the screen stays on. < br / > < br / > overall , i have to say , would rather pay 1/3 to 1/4 the price and deal with the drawbacks . having said that , it is really annoying that i can not use the built in flash . if it were a bit more expensive , i would return it just because i want things that work 100 % . < br / > < br / > update : used this in the field snorkeling and it was excellent . it was capable of diving at least 5 meters without an issue . for the price , there is no better value ! upgrading from 4 stars to 5 . i was mistaken , there is no design for the flash to work . you need an external underwater light if you wish to illuminate underwater . ignore the deducted points for that . the water detection is still cheap , but it should serve ok. just test before putting underwater just in case !
__label__positive__ these are the large size 6 1/2 & # 34 ; x 3 1/4 & # 34 ; which i prefer over the smaller one . price was the selling point at $ 10.00 for 15 books that about 65cents a book . great add-on item if you are purchasing enough stuff for free shipping .
__label__neutral__ feels a little fragile , but classic in appearance . i think my dad had a case like this .
__label__positive__ nice camera !
__label__positive__ the bundle was of great value and the savings afforded me the opportunity to purchase other accessories .
__label__positive__ awesome works great
__label__positive__ works great . paired easily with a galaxy s5 . as george c mentioned , the instructions indicate the device will identify as & # 34 ; winnersun & # 34 ; but the device actually identifies as & # 34 ; ba-1025. & # 34 ; the large thumbscrews make adjustment easy . the phone holding clamp uses strong springs to hold your device safely . the telescoping rod has sufficient friction to stay extended but not too much to make extension difficult .
__label__positive__ love love love they work great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
__label__positive__ exactly as expected .
__label__positive__ great camera
__label__positive__ excellent build quality , very fast focus and very good bokah i loved it and highly recommend it .
__label__positive__ this reflector/diffuser is perfect . frame is sturdy and easy to assemble and disassemble . this is quickly becoming my go to lighting tool .
__label__positive__ this case is the perfect size to fit my canon powershot g7 x camera . i highly recommend .
__label__positive__ have n't used it yet , but what i see -- - i like !
__label__positive__ the product is as advertised , what more can you ask for .
__label__negative__ i just got the lens mount adapter m42 ( type 2 ) lens for my takumar smc 50mm 1.4 and it is completely a waste of money , it would not properly work on my d3100 which it clearly states on the description that it will work properly and reach infinity . however , it does not . it barely fits with a lot of streght to place it in , and it continues to say that there are no lens mounted . i setted on manual as it would never work on any of the automatic settings because it doesnt have the cpu system in it like the nikkor lens . i have tried to contact the seller , but there is no way to do it . i recommend you not to buy this item , for i am really unsatisfied with it .
__label__negative__ after hearing great reviews about this tiny quad i decided to give it a try . i was just looking for an inexpensive quad to manually fly around. < br / > < br / > arrived quickly thanks to amazon prime . decent build quality for the price . flew great for about 5-6 flights . easy to control , easy to see , good distance . around the 7 the flight two of the motors stopped working and it would n't take off . batteries were all charged , never crashed , no loose screws . returning the item and will most likely look for one of better quality. < br / > < br / > i did n't expect it to last too long do to the low cost , but 35-40 minutes is too short to give a positive review .
__label__positive__ i 'm useing it on a 70d and it 's done very well . came with a lens hood and case .
__label__positive__ good quality
__label__positive__ i received this stabilizer on august 6th , and i have been using it for a while . the laing p-04 is a great stabilizer for the money . it feels very good in the hand , and is made beautifully . i love it . it took me some time to master the weight and balancing , so i went to youtube and watched some videos . here is one , & # 34 ; laing stabilizer p-4s adjusting & operating tutorial & # 34 ; < br / > < br / > https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=i9yok2zfja8 < br / > < br / > enjoy !
__label__positive__ far better price than oem . batteries have held up well since purchase 1 1/2 years ago . though oem battery tends to last longer .
__label__positive__ basic surveillance camera it is color when there is enough light , otherwise it is just b & w with infrared in the dark . it has a microphone so one can also hear the audio in the location . it is light and can be mounted on a wall or just placed on a table . it does require to be close to a power outlet to be plugged in via an adaptor . it is very easy to setup , just follow the installation directions that come with the camera . once that is done the user can download the app and watch what the camera sees .
__label__positive__ the camera works very well for now , the only annoying feature is that it is noisy when we take a picture . the pictures are beautiful , it is easy to use and not too heavy . in the bundle , the extra battery is very useful , so is the sd card . the tripod is much to small to be useful , and the case is much too big , we bought another one much smaller . but since the bundle was the same price as the camera by itself we can not complain .
__label__positive__ protects screen , and fits
__label__positive__ great for boating or the pool . easy to attach .
__label__negative__ poor quality < br / > the resilience and strength of the material is very bad
__label__positive__ this bag is perfect for travel and allows me the versatility of packing not only all my camera equipment and computer , but also other small things i need from my purse so that it is not necessary for me to carry a purse any longer .
__label__positive__ i have owned this ( +3 others ) camera for about a month now . i like it 95 % of the time , however , it does seem to go offline at random times. < br / > it was a bit of a pain to configure the cloud recording ; i ended up having to call tech support , and they did resolve the situation in about 40 minutes. < br / > the picture is great and the camera control is easy to use and high quality . i have a dropcam and the picture is about the same ; however the audio is terrible on this model . you really ca n't hear anything and i would consider this feature to be useless . the audio on the dropcam is much better. < br / > < br / > i am happy with these cameras for the price , but if you need audio , it is not the right product for you .
__label__positive__ worked as intended , kept water out : )
__label__positive__ perfect size for my gopro . now i want other sizes .
__label__positive__ great flyer and tough . excellent training drone
__label__negative__ the orange disc on each pad has melted due to exposure to the sun and remains gooey . they are no longer useable .
__label__positive__ works great with my 70d . super good price . love it !
__label__positive__ mom loves her
__label__positive__ awesome price awesome device love it
__label__positive__ it works good
__label__neutral__ appearently lost of the reviews are about free product . i bought it recently , which is the 6th cam i have bought over the past a few years . the unit came with poor manual instructions , but after installing 6 similar units , the manual seems to be unnecessary anyways . the function buttons are somewhat simple once you play around with it but i still prefer some kind of information . the mirror glares and the initial set up allows the video one all time , which made the glare worse . the powet cord is too short , i need to buy a seperate one . the strap to attach the rear mirror to the original mirror is cheap made and i think it will fall off soon , but a rubber band should work . the unit however works well otherwise . functions are comparible to other products . image is clear .
__label__positive__ no idea how much more i can urge anyone to buy this . digital and cell phone images are great , but this ! ! ! is a must ! ! !
__label__positive__ works as described .
__label__positive__ the camera is easy to use and carry in your pocket . i had it my pool and it worked fine . i 'm happy i made the choice and got it .
__label__positive__ have n't been robbed yet .
__label__positive__ 10-2-15 if you are having issues with color calibration for your .arw / .dng files ... read on ... this will be my final update . first off , sorry if my reviews have been all over the place but it has been difficult to sort out how to use this camera with lightroom as i am use to canon cameras . my reviews have gone from 4 to 1 to 3 to 1 again and now i am back at 4 , although i would say its a 4minus . my main issues with the camera were in regards to its difficult interface with lightroom , as you can see from my posts below . however , i have dealt with these issues to the best of my abilities and figured out that a big part of what was bothering me was not just about the camera and about lightroom but not knowing how to use the cameras features in conjunction with lightrooms features . for the longest time i could not figure out how to calibrate the .arw files in the sony rx100 iv in lightroom . it was very frustrating and it still is to a degree but i have figured out what i was not seeing . when lightroom copies your .arw sony file as a .dng file and imports it into lightroom , it does not automatically calibrate that image , you have to do this yourself in the develop module in lightroom . so what happens is that lightroom imports the .dng file and that file appears to be very different then what you see on your camera . this bothered incredibly , but here 's what you have to do : go to the develop module & # 62 ; go down to the bottom panel on the right side where you see the camera calibration settings & # 62 ; change the & # 34 ; profile & # 34 ; setting to the matching setting that you have in your sony camera , so if you shot your images in vivid mode , or portrait mode , change lightroom setting to those profiles ! & # 62 ; if you adjusted saturation/contrast/sharpness in your sony camera you will have to adjust these again in the develop module to accurately recreate the sony .arw file so that the .arw file and the .dng file look the same . this should pretty much get the job done , however istill see subtle differences , but for the most part i am satisfied . i do want to add that there is quite a bit of image noise , even with low iso . i 've also had problems with the shutter on the lens getting stuck . still , for a pocket camera , it takes some damn nice photos and is a useful tool . 9-22-15 if you use lightroom do not buy this camera ! ! ! please read my reviews below to understand the issue i a complaining about and why i am strongly advising that anyone who uses lightroom to not buy this product ! so , from where i left off last i thought that the problem of lightroom integration with the sony .raw/.arw file integration was solved and that i could move on . unfortunately this is not the case . while lightroom can now import sony 's .arw files and convert those files to .dng files , the image quality once your files are converted and imported into lightroom is sadly , absolutely poor quality ! when comparing files that have not been imported to lightroom with those that have been imported it is just so blatant to see that the files that have been imported just look bad ! in comparison . again , the colors look totally flat , and lack luster , the shadows or darker colors especially loose saturation and vitality , everything just looks weak and totally boring ! photos that were shot with the sony & # 34 ; vivid & # 34 ; feature do not look & # 34 ; vivid & # 34 ; at all ! and what is so frustrating is that even though these photos are .dng files , you still can not edit them in a way that improves the photo or enhances in such a way that it looks closer to the original non-imported photo ! i was hoping i could create a preset that would help make the imported photos look closer to the original but this is just not possible at all , the color difference between the two photos is just to stark . literally , all the colors in your original photo are different colors in the imported version of that same photo . i 'm very upset and disappointed about this ! i almost do n't even want to sell this camera because i do not want someone else to have to go through this . this was an important decision to buy this camera , i thought i was getting the best and latest technology . i made the wrong decision , i just hope that anyone who reads this looks elsewhere and does not make the same mistake as i did when i spent a $ g on this camera . my last hope is in buying that other piece of software to see if works with the sony .arw files , and perhaps the word will travel and adobe and sony will fix this issue . whatever is going on has to do with the rgb not matching up as the color difference is wild . do n't believe me , just check the images below ! original review i would like to give this camera a five star rating , and in terms of & # 34 ; quality & # 34 ; for a compact camera , it deserves five stars . however , my biggest problem impacts heavily what my feelings are for this camera . the problem is that the cameras raw files ( sony uses .arw files as its raw format ) do not import into lightroom ! damn it ! no , .arw files are not recognized by the latest version of lightroom 5.7.1 on a macbook pro retina , so you can not plug in your camera , import and convert .arw files to .dng files for use in lightroom . ca n't do it ! now , i 've downloaded the sony image converter , so if i want to , i can convert my .arw files to tiff files and those files do load into lightroom and they look good and are similar to raw files in many ways , they have that added quality and malleability . however , and this is a big drawback , tiff files are much larger than raw files , from 3x as large to 6x as large , an 8bit tiff file is about 60mb , a 16bit tiff file is 120mb ! suddenly working with raw files is taking up even more space . and , it takes a lot of time to convert these files , sort and organize them , and even more time with loading ! loading is often very slow , and for some reason lightroom thumbnails often go blank . it makes working frustrating and aggravating . at this point , i 'd rather just shoot jpeg , but thats thing thing , i spent the extra money because i wanted that extra bit of quality , i wanted to shoot in raw ! and though i am not a professional photographer my photography is still very important to me and when i bought the camera , my plan was to shoot raw like i do with my canon 5d mark ii . so i got ta say ... i 'm disappointed in this outcome . i 'm still trying to fix this issue and hopefully it can be fixed . i thought i found the solution when i came across a piece of adobe software that converted .arw files to .dng files ( adobe digital negative converter ) . i thought this would be perfect and fix the issue . no go ! after converting a batch of .arw files to .dng files i compared them and the .dng files were like mud , very clearly lacking in color , totally dull and flat . so this is also very much an adobe issue as well as a sony issue . but it needs to be fixed sony/lightroom ! if anyone has similar issues and has found a way to fix it please let me know ! i am just resigned to shooting jpeg at the moment . i do n't want to deal with jpeg + raw , too chaotic . and i do n't want to deal with converting to tiff , to much space and too hard to work with . only when conditions are perfect for shooting will i switch to using raw/tiff . i hope this was helpful . its a shame because it really is an expensive and amazing camera , but an amazing camera that does not smoothly interface with your powerful , industry standard software , is honestly just ... sad . i hope this was helpful . update : for those who have upgraded to lightroom 6 disregard the review above . lightroom 6 does accept .arw files ! i will leave the review here so ppl can see that this issue has been resolved ! i also wanted to note that i had another issue come up with the sony rx100 iv , and that is that the lens cover that automatically opens and closes when the camera is turned on/off was getting stuck recently and would not open fully , only partially . this was really annoying , i had to push the cover to get it to fully open andthere was a black spot showing on the screen where the lens cover was . i 'm not sure what happened , i 've treated the camera very well since i 've had , i have not banged it or dropped it , nothing like that . i cleaned the lens and turned the camera off and on and eventually the camera cover started opening properly again , but i am worried that the problem could come back . this happened with an old point and shoot canon i use to own , but only after 3 years and plenty of abuse . we shall see how this issues plays out , yes indeed , we shall see ... ?
__label__positive__ works wonders . my gear has never been more clean .

__label__positive__ i was supposed to meet my spouse for dinner at five , five o'clock comes and goes and she is nowhere to be seen . i am getting worried so i get my phone out and take a peek at our three nest cams i recently installed . i saw her asleep on the couch ... i used the & # 34 ; mic & # 34 ; feature to politely wake her up and remind her that we had plans . she hates the nest cam , but i love it ! amazing technology , i love the mic/sound feature , the 1080p , and the night vision . we use the cams for the purpose of occasionally watching our cats and lazy spouses , not to record and keep data . i highly recommend 100 % .
__label__positive__ just what i was looking for
__label__positive__ having bought and returned two sets of different versions of these triggers..that did not work , and spending a lot of time in reviewing forums , configurations , technical service ... my conclusion are these : fuji xt1 owners , it is not true that nikon or canon versions would work with your fuji . only canon version of this particulat yn trigger works with xt1 . and works great .
__label__positive__ great little monitor .
__label__negative__ these lights have absolutely no power . had to place them inches from subject 's face .
__label__positive__ more lightweight than the 'brand ' named cap/cover , but i really like the cord that allows you to attach the lens cap to my camera strap so i wo n't lose it .

__label__positive__ excellent camera , superb optics , produces outstanding images . this is an every-day-carry camera . light enough to go to the mountains and enough features to use in the studio . optics are amazing , ease of use simple enough for the & # 34 ; beginner & # 34 ; . the zoom is sharp as a tack in macro mode or fully extended to the 400mm , telephoto mode .
__label__neutral__ i bought this specifically for shooting fireworks over the lake at my in-laws house . it 's not complete crap but it is n't going to win any prizes either. < br / > < br / > the good : < br / > 1 . it it light and small enough to pack into my carry-on bag for air travel. < br / > 2 . has quick release , easy adjust legs which were sturdy enough for my sony mirrorless body and lenses. < br / > 3 . the ball head is n't horrible , not great but not horrible . used it with my largest zoom lenses and had no wandering issues in any position. < br / > 4 . very lightweight , only 1 lb 14 ozs in the carry bag. < br / > < br / > the bad : < br / > 1 . the camera mounting plate is not detachable making quick changes to a second body/lens impossible . also pretty sure this will be the first thing that will break. < br / > 2 . the ball head is not detachable and i suspect the second thing that will break. < br / > 3 . overall height was very short . i am 5 ' 4 & # 34 ; and it was below my eye line . for anyone taller this could be a deal breaker. < br / > 4 . no levels but i always have a bubble level in my bag so that was n't a huge issue for me. < br / > < br / > i am keeping this tripod because it suits my needs for weekend trips via air travel when i do n't want to check bags and maybe just maybe i might need a tripod . i would not recommend this for any full size dslr or for any shoot where the results matter i.e . paid gigs , family weddings , etc , the stability just is n't there . but if you are looking for something lightweight to use with a mirrorless system to toss into your bag & # 34 ; just in case & # 34 ; then go for it .
__label__positive__ i own hoya introductory kits for all of the camera lenses i own that will take one . they make top quality filters which you can be proud to own . these filters are constructed from optical glass within an aluminum-alloy frame , which protect the front element of a lens from scratches , bumps , or impacts . this kit includes everyday filters that all photographers should own regardless of skill level . it also includes a convenient carrying/storage filter pouch . details from the hoya website about the filters included in this kit : < br / > < br / > hoya uv filter < br / > < br / > - absorbs uv light and reduces bluish cast of daylight. < br / > - does not require adjustments to exposure while in use. < br / > - single coated to prevent internal ghosting and reflections while providing approximately 96 % light transmission. < br / > - creates no additional coloration or contrast. < br / > - general protection filter reduces dust , moisture , and scratches from reaching lens elements. < br / > < br / > hoya circular polarizer filter < br / > < br / > - helps to reduce reflections and glare by filtering out light that has become polarized due to reflection from a non-metallic surface. < br / > - polarizing filters arrange , and filter , directionally polarized light perpendicularly to the reflected light , allowing for the absorption of much of the light. < br / > - clears up haze in distant landscapes and provides more saturated , vivid colors. < br / > - strongest effect when used at a 90° angle from the sun. < br / > - circular polarizers are ideal for use with digital cameras and autofocus lenses where a linear polarizer will often disrupt auto exposure and focus features. < br / > - non-coated < br / > - approximately 96 % average light transmission. < br / > - 3 to 4x filter factor reduces exposure by 1.6 to 2 stops. < br / > - note : the thickness of this filter 's frame is slimmer than the one sold in the kit this one replaces ( filter kit set i ) < br / > < br / > hoya ndx8 nd ( neutral density ) filter < br / > < br / > - enables slow shutter speeds to be used , especially with fast films , to record movement in subjects such as waterfalls , clouds , cars , seas etc. < br / > - decreases depth of field by allowing wider apertures to be used , which helps separate subjects from their background. < br / > - decreased the effective iso of high speed film ( i.e . : above iso400 ) and allow it to be used outdoors in blight situations. < br / > - allows cine and video cameras ( which have fixed shutter speeds ) to film subjects such as snow , sand or other bright scenes which would normally cause over-exposure.ield by allowing wider apertures to be used , which helps separate subjects from their background . - decreased the effective iso of high speed film ( i.e . : above iso400 ) and allow it to be used outdoors in blight situations . - allows cine and video cameras ( which have fixed shutter speeds ) to film subjects such as snow , sand or other bright scenes which would normally cause over-exposure .
__label__positive__ i had an issue setting up my dcs-5020l after i moved to a different location . i had to call tech support to get help as setting the camera thru the ios app did not work to register my camera to mydlink website.. when called tech support i technician randy b # ar004232 answered my service call and helped me set up my camera using the correct setup wizard he was pleasant and helpful.. he also help me set up my wireless connection and everything finished successfully . thanks dlink tech support .
__label__neutral__ weather sealing is good , fits lenses in three compartments the lens fit very snugly , an extra inch or two wider would have made this more comfortable when finding and extracting lenses , the bag is not square tapering to the bottom reduces internal storage ( hence another two inches wider at bottom would have been better ) . the unzipping at the top is sub optimal - when trying to unzip the bag rather than a zip which unzips two inches then goes across the bag and then unzip two inches up the bag it would be a lot , lot better to have the zip in an oval shape so that the unzipping could be done in one simple action . i want speed and ease of use i do n't want to concentrate every time i need to unzip the bag . i 'll be buying another this time not on the internet . it 's useful for minimal gear transport ie two lenses and polarizing filters etc for a quick trip. < br / > if you want it it can pack what they say but not easily i 'm storing a sony a 6000 , 70 -200mm , 50mm , rokinon12mm and i 'm full so i need more space i should be able to get in 4 lenses into two compartments plus camera and 70 -200mm attached but the tapering at the bottom prevents that , it 's annoying its just a little too small because of the tapering and it also does not stand upright because it does not have a flat base ( the taper stuffs it up ) ..
__label__positive__ excellent !
__label__positive__ this kit is just what i needed to be able to take my gopro with me anywhere and everywhere . i love having all these different options for my camera now so i can pick the perfect one depending on what it is that i am going to be doing for the day. < br / > < br / > when the kit first arrived i was a bit overwhelmed to just see all of the different pieces in the clear plastic bag , but it did n't take long at all for me to figure out what was what . pretty soon i was up and running , testing them out on my first excursion. < br / > < br / > included in the kit are : < br / > ▸ head belt strap mount < br / > ▸chest belt strap mount < br / > ▸extendable handle monopod ( selfie stick ) < br / > ▸large diameter car suction cup mount < br / > ▸bike handlebar holder mount < br / > < br / > all of the accessories work perfectly , and are very well made and sturdy . i feel comfortable that my gopro is secure and i have never had to worry about it coming loose or falling during one of my many adventures . for me , this is a must have kit and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
__label__negative__ the camera records only a black screen in low light . the battery is weak . the first time i tested it , it ran for 19 hours , but it died much more quickly during the second test . i could not get the camera to work while attached to a usb power supply . you have to allow the camera to operate , so that it produces a text file which you can then edit to set the time and date for accurate time and date stamping on the videos . but the second time i tested it , the camera spontaneously re-set the date and time twice in a two day period , then stopped working altogether . so , if you are looking to document evidence of wrong-doing , you can assume the time stamps on the videos will be worthless . the audio pick-up was better than i expected . i got some cute videos of family members practicing musical instruments . but the camera is a toy , not a security camera . if you get one and it does not fail within the first two weeks of operation , i think you will need to check it 2 to 4 times a day to be sure it is time date stamping videos correctly . i 'm sure there are standard computer web cameras which are more reliable for less than the $ 49 i paid for this camera . i returned it . amazon 's handling of the return was superb .
__label__negative__ was not the 8p model nvr . i had to purchase an additional poe switch to be able to use this nvr .
__label__positive__ this replaced one i had lost in the river . i tried a different power shot but it was n't the same . i was so glad to find an exact replacement because of the quality of the pictures it takes without having to change a lot of settings .
__label__positive__ perfect fit case .
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ second one , first one lost its siren . but helps broadcast the message .
__label__positive__ it works just the way it supposed to be .
__label__positive__ fantastic camera . lens is outstanding - firmware updates keep getting better . auto-tracking is pretty stellar ( some bugs but when it works it shines )
__label__positive__ i typically try to buy accessories that are the same brand as the item . however , i was searching on amazon for the best deal and came across this battery . my husband has heard of this brand before as his boss uses this same brand . we decided to give it a try since it was much less than the canon counterpart . we purchased it because we were taking a family trip to new york and wanted to be sure to not run out of battery mid day . this battery stayed charged for several days and we never missed an opportunity for a great picture in the big apple !
__label__positive__ awesome camera ! exactly what i wanted as my first slr .
__label__positive__ great cable
__label__positive__ overall this is a pretty decent backpack for transporting my phantom 3 . if you prefer a backpack over a hard shell case , this is the way to go. < br / > < br / > pros < br / > - construction is durable < br / > - waist and chest strap < br / > - most components of the phantom fit snugly into the foam compartments < br / > - room for 5 spare batteries < br / > - lots of extra pockets to store things in < br / > - lightweight < br / > < br / > cons < br / > - props do not fit well in the slot called out in the product photos ; they ’ ll need to be stored elsewhere in the backpack < br / > - as an adult in my mid-30s , i could do without a backpack that has “ fearless ” stamped on it in big block letters < br / > < br / > note : i received this item at a discount in exchange for writing this review .
__label__positive__ i ordered this for my neighbor , he really likes the quality of the pictures he gets .
__label__positive__ good for the price . really creates the appearance of a tv
__label__neutral__ pretty cheap and flimsy . will do the job in a pinch , but i would not recommend buying it for a full camera . maybe if you only wanted to use it for a small digital camera .
__label__positive__ perfect fit to my empty case . very easy to customize .
__label__positive__ sent this as a gift and the recipient loves it ! ! if has everything needed for a person who is traveling and hates to carry bulky accessories .
__label__negative__ very stiff
__label__positive__ great camera , still learning all of the features
__label__negative__ very cheap quality . you get what you pay for .
__label__positive__ works great as a small light box . as other reviews mention , you need to iron this when it arrives , but that 's not a big deal. < br / > < br / > my main issue is that the top panel sags heavily after about a month of use . i need to find something rigid to support it , or bend it back into shape without breaking it .
__label__positive__ product was as advertised .

__label__positive__ this item looks great and seems to be made very well . works perfect and very easy to use . everything was as described and works great . it fits very well to my gopro camera . great value for the money . i highly recommend this to everyone .

__label__negative__ returned thak you
__label__positive__ i ca n't live without this thing . looks like tupperware , works like magic . love the straps at the base that keeps it from falling off .
__label__neutral__ my initial thoughts after taking it out of the box is that it is very sleek looking home security camera . this is the only camera out of the four that we have that is black . black seems to blend in a little more in the decor so that is a plus . it is also a very sturdy camera . it has some weight to it and it can be maneuvered quite a lot to get just the shot you are looking for . when we first got the camera we decided to aim it at our backyard so we could keep an eye on any comings and goings in our patio area. < br / > < br / > video quality : immediately i was amazed at the clarity of the camera . the camera is sitting inside the house about six feet from the window . despite that fact it is still showing just about everything outside . of all the cameras i have this one definitely has the best quality in photos both during the live mode and recorded mode . the simplicam also has night vision. < br / > < br / > sound quality : the simplicam home security camera was very easy to set up . it is been a while since it was set up but i believe it was just plugging it in , downloading the app , and scanning the qr code on my phone . in addition to the photo quality the sound it can pick up is also quite remarkable . i ’ m currently sitting at home by myself and decided to do a screenshot of my current setup up and while i was taking the photo i could actually hear through the camera the screenshot capture sound on my iphone . i am not even close to the camera but it could still pick it up . occasionally the camera will pick up voices outside when someone walks by the house. < br / > < br / > face recognition technology : i thought it would be really cool if my home security camera could alert me to when my boys come home from school . sadly a week has gone by and i have not been able to get that feature to work properly . rarely does it recognize anyone and it does not notify me . however to be fair it is currently in beta and i have been asked to contact support about my issue. < br / > < br / > accessing camera : while the camera can be accessed any time during the day and you can see a live feed it is also recording for you to look back through your day . the amount you can go back in time will depend on the plan you chose which i will talk more about below . however one thing i did find that was interesting is you can filter your recordings by different features such as : all , motion , sounds , face. < br / > < br / > light sensitivity : i found that using the faces event filter helped the most . this camera is so sensitive that as the light shifts outside it detects motion and considers it is motion event . considering the alternative it not detecting motion i don ’ t think it is a bad thing . i was somewhat disappointed that all day yesterday we at in our dining area and were walking back and forth and it still never recognized a face : ( . < br / > < br / > motion/sound sensitivity : there is a sensativity setting where you can tell it how to track motion and sound . such as bam , default , whisper . or crash , default , tiptoe . we have decided to keep ours at the default level. < br / > < br / > plans : you must have a plan if you want to see anything more than a live feed . in order to use the face recognition and recorded video you must subscribe to one of these plans . a plan is not required to use the camera but without the recording it would simply be a live camera only . you would be able to check in on your home or children as needed but would not have access to any footage prior to your check it as the simplicam would not be recording. < br / > < br / > i gave it a three for two reasons , the face recognition does not appear to work as advertised and you have to have a plan to record anything . the cheapest plan at $ 49.99 a month only allows you to record one day . i think that a security camera is best if it can go back 7 days , that is my preference. < br / > < br / > i received this product and lifetime recording in exchange for my honest opinion . i have taken it upon myself to post an amazon review . if you feel thisreview was helpful i encourage you to vote so below . if you have any questions i 'm happy to answer.o answer .

__label__positive__ nice little tripod . i use it to replace a similar pod that was stolen . use it for holding my chronograph . only draw back is the attaching 1/4-20 stud thumbwheel is small & a bugger to use quickly . for the price & type of use , it does the job . if the tripod takes a bullet hit , the cost of replacing is n't a disaster . comes with a nylon drawstring carry case
__label__positive__ [ [ videoid:31371cc673a82777f1bde7ad0f0add65 ] ] i would say this is a good variety of accessories for a gopro camera . there are definitely more things out there , but these accessories really allow you to be able to use your gopro in a lot of different ways . i do wish i got one that included a case , but that 's no deal breaker . for the price , it 's a great buy ! < br / > < br / > head strap and chest harness : these pieces are made of good quality elastic , adjust to your size and fit comfortably . i like on the head strap that you have the option to wear over a helmet and it does fit . the chest harness can be adjusted depending what clothing you are wearing . i like the different perspectives of video and photos you can get with all of these different options ! < br / > < br / > handheld monopod : this item is extendable and is not too heavy . it is made of good quality product and is n't too hard to open and close . it 's cool it can be adjusted , which can provide a 180-degree angle to shoot . it can be used as a selfie stick too . this was a fun one to try out since you do n't have to ask a friend to shoot you ! with gopros i notice a lot of the time the videographer is n't in the shots . i found out you can even use the rotating base to expand your shots ! < br / > < br / > suction cup : this was a fun item to try on a car and when i have the chance i will definitely use on a boat . make sure you try and use a clean surface so the suction holds properly. < br / > < br / > floating hand grip : this has potential to be really fun , though i have yet to try it . it 's buoyant handgrip makes it so it 's very stabile and in control so you can take great pictures easily . a friend of mine has this and loves using it ! < br / > < br / > axis handle bar and mounting bracket : the pieces are made with to go on a bike handlebar or similar . it seemed to work as described and was made of good quality plastic . after testing this out . i plan to use this on my bike a lot. < br / > < br / > overall , i would say these are definitely good quality fun pieces that would be good if someone is trying to get more into using the gopro . there really are a lot of options on how to use them so why not take advantage ! i am definitely looking to expand my knowledge and be able to take better footage ! this set is definitely a good investment. < br / > < br / > i included a basic video to show all of the pieces to get an idea of what is included. < br / > < br / > note : this item was received at a discount in return for my honest unbiased review .
__label__positive__ the product itself is great ! i got it quite quickly and it worked very nicely . the only complaint i have is that the tripod stand will not fit together due to the screw to connect the stand to the phone holder . the screw is not long enough to connect and screw on . has anyone had the same problem ?
__label__positive__ great sports cam for much less than a gopro
__label__positive__ love it ! got it for a hello kitty baby shower photo booth ! was a lot of fun to go old school with poloroid type pictures . pictures are actually really good quality . would recommend for a hello kitty fan but if not a fan i would still recommend the instax camera !
__label__positive__ nicely designed , simple to use . definitely made with cheap materials but for the cost it does a great job . i 'm surprised my heavy phone did not tip it over , even with the legs extended all the way . would recommend .
__label__neutral__ decent camera . i used in europe , the flash is very poor . there is also no room for your thumb and it hits some of the buttons causing unintentional functions . the menu system is not as intuitive as it could be . it does take a very good picture and the 30 x telephoto is so much better than past models . overall its a very good advanced pocket camera , only gets a three due to concerns above .
__label__negative__ my now husband ordered this camera in may as a present for me before our destination wedding . he left in in the box until giving it to me last week . when we tried to set up the camera it says & # 34 ; lens error & # 34 ; and wo n't take photos . unfortunately we are stuck with it because the return policy is 30 days . he should 've checked it out upon receipt but the camera should also be functional upon purchase .
__label__negative__ i 'm very disappointed in this product . 9 out of 10 slides got stuck inside , instead of sliding through . the package looked like it had been opened previously , based on the way it was put together , not typical of a factory packed product , and the 'tongue ' of the carton was badly bent . poor quality . i returned it .
__label__positive__ exactly what i needed . i 'm a little computer savy and had to do a little research on the app needed to view remotely from my ipad ( ivsp app ) , once installed , sign in as visitor , should have icon under device . doubletap and then press connect .
__label__positive__ excellent bundle package .
__label__negative__ it was broke when it arrived , light meter did n't even work .
__label__positive__ easily doubles shooting time ! installs in seconds , makes holding the camera more natural for vertical shots with second shutter release . well made and fits perfectly .
__label__positive__ the blues are lighter & the purples are highlights are fewer and darker than the example displayed . exactly what i wanted !
__label__negative__ really really wanted this to work . i received this yesterday to use in my business . my husband tried to install it on our wifi at the shop . he got it to the point of inserting the sd card . everything seemed to be fine . we were still connected with the cord to the router and it worked . then he tries to put the sd card in . i do n't think he 's use to working with the smaller sd cards and had a very difficult time putting it in . he finally got it to read the card , but then the internet connection would go out . if he took the card out , he would get the internet back . this went on for a few hours trying to figure this out . the still shots were what i really bought this camera for . i 'm not going to sit around and watch who comes to the door ( inside ) 24/7 . i wanted to see who was going in and out of my shop or if my boxes as been picked up and so forth . he never could seem to get the sd card to work and the internet connection . really strange. < br / > < br / > fast foward ... .. it is the next morning and i decided to try from scratch to install this camera in my home . i figure my husband must have been doing something wrong . we are not amateurs with electronic devices and i really could n't figure out why he was having such difficulty over at my shop . i plugged in the ac adapter to an outlet and then plugged the ethernet cord into my router . the vimtag is on because of the red light on the right side . but it is not even connecting to my internet here at the house at all . no green lights ... . nothing . i 've waited about 3 minutes inbetween tries and nothing. < br / > < br / > so needless to say i am very disappointed with this product . not sure if we just got a defective one or not , but i find it really , really strange that both my husband ( over at my shop ) and myself here at home can not get this thing to work for various reasons . like i said before , this is not our first rodeo with electronic devices but after a quick call to the company , i plan on returning this product . does anyone know of another similar product for us to try . we really need the still shots to be captures but i 'm not seeing that features on any of the other cameras like this .
__label__positive__ it helps to take selfis ! ! ! yayyy ! !
__label__positive__ excellent grip
__label__positive__ they fit perfectly and work great . definitely worth the money to have a few extra or to replace any in need . shipping did take a while but that 's expected when coming from another country .
__label__positive__ great package at the right price
__label__negative__ did not appeal to me .
__label__positive__ this has been an amazing and affordable camera to just start learning about photo/videography . i have never had an issue with this camera after nearly 2.5 years , but i now need to upgrade due to doing professional wedding videography . this camera does n't have a high enough resolution for professional use , and canon rebel cameras are n't very good for low light , so i have some issues at wedding receptions getting decent footage . the 18-55mm lens is n't very good , though , so i might suggest purchasing body only and get a slightly better lens like the 24-70mm . your photos will hardly look high quality at all with this kit lens . i have n't used my kit lens since the month i got my camera. < br / > < br / > oh , and i love that this dslr has a flip-screen . it has been amazingly helpful for video purposes .
__label__positive__ the zippers look cheap but until now they are working great. < br / > i have made a inside foam core to arrange my stuff .
__label__positive__ very good very fast thank you
__label__positive__ amazing , especially considering the price . the battery only lasts about 10 minutes , so i recommend buying extra . the camera is not bad and works nice , the package even comes with a card reader that plugs into your computer or laptop so you can view the videos or pictures you 've taken , the card reader would also work with any micro sd card you have , which is a plus . it also comes with 2 extra propellers , so do not bother buying extra replacements as they are very unlike to snap or break anyway .
__label__positive__ great camera , now i want the newest version
__label__negative__ terrible security camera . the picture is good enough when monitoring manually , but i ca n't set up a schedule to record ( it rejects a time value of , say , 11pm to 6am ) , it never triggers on motion , and i ca n't get it to record to anything other than the sd card ( which is never going to survive when someone breaking in sees the camera ) . and the pan/tilt is not good for anything other than manually monitoring either , you ca n't set it to look at a wider area . maybe i just have n't spent enough time messing around with it , but the dropcam setup was far easier and covered everything i wanted it to do . i 'd still have one instead of this foscam if they did n't hobble it so that you have to pay their extortion fees every year .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ nice little compact case
__label__positive__ never thought i 'd own a selfie stick , but i 'm going to greece and thought , hey ! why not ! easy to put your phone in and great entertainment !
__label__negative__ i did a bit of research on this before i bought it . i thought it did what i wanted . i could n't find any reviews or any video/screenshots of the camera in action -- even from the swannone website . maybe that should have been cause for concern. < br / > < br / > what was good about it : < br / > * setup was pretty easy . plug network cable in , use the website to set it up , then connect it to wifi. < br / > * the motion detection was great , even in darkness. < br / > * the video image ( when it worked ) was great , even in darkness < br / > < br / > here 's what was not good about it : < br / > * you need a device to use the camera . although you set it up through the website , and change the settings on the website , you ca n't view video on the website . you need an app on a device to do it. < br / > * the video streaming is terrible . even with full signal strength , the longest video stream it managed was about 10 seconds . sometimes that stream was 10 minutes old . sometimes the app just said that the camera was n't available . i walked past the camera a few times and the video stream stopped when it detected motion . that meant i did n't appear on the video stream . pretty much useless if you want to see what triggered the motion sensor. < br / > * swannone assumes you want to be alerted every time the camera detects motion . the app gave me a sound + popup notification that there was motion . i turned off notifications . in the morning i had 115 emails on behalf of the camera -- each one telling me that the camera had detected motion . i could n't see an easy way to turn the email alerts off , but i did n't look very hard -- by then i was so sick of trying to get the & # 34 ; live viewing & # 34 ; to work that i 'd decided to return the camera. < br / > < br / > i bought the camera to use the advertised & # 34 ; live view & # 34 ; feature . it achieved that less than 1 % of the time .
__label__positive__ awesome for the price . i bought 6 for my two cameras . i 'll never run out when i need the camera most !
__label__positive__ works well
__label__positive__ great products everything was included in the kit happy customer
__label__positive__ it 's super gucci i love it it makes my pictures look gr8
__label__positive__ perfect ! kind of confusing instructions , but easy to figure out using the pictures !
__label__positive__ generally i would n't write a review for such an inexpensive item , but i thought i would pass on to anyone considering this that it works perfect for me . i have it on my canon eos 70d . i slipped right into the hotshoe and does it 's job perfectly .
__label__positive__ works to get better looking video using my dslr nikon camera
__label__positive__ quite possibly the best series of eyepieces in this price range . stars are sharp across the field . i 've been very involved in amateur astronomy for over 40 years . i 've owned 9 different telescopes of all types and quite a number of eyepieces , ( i wo n't even hazard a guess on how many ) from inexpensive erfle 's and kellners to high quality naglers . in my opinion this series of eyepiece is a top performer and a great value .
__label__positive__ we had replaced our entry door and needed also to replace the sensor . this sensor matched the old existing sensor to a tee ( considering the old sensor was 18 years old ) . easy to install with no clinches . the only negative is that it came only in white . it would have been nice to have had a brown colored sensor to better match the mahogany door . but nonetheless a good product !
__label__positive__ aa++ seller comes in handy in the 8shots.com office . great conversation piece
__label__negative__ a rip off . cheap and cheezy . they do n't deserve one star . they should be ashamed . their ad looks great . that is how they got me .
__label__positive__ very good
__label__neutral__ well it works , but ive noticed that most of the time its a bit blurry . depends on what your looking at i guess .
__label__positive__ great backdrop affordable large and wear extremely well ! ! super portable !
__label__positive__ great value works superbly for wedding shoot
__label__positive__ heavy duty case . used to secure my gopro and accessories .
__label__neutral__ tripod was damage . delivery was fast .
__label__positive__ priced well , quality is good and above some other products that i have seen which were much more expensive .
__label__positive__ i happy with it . just wish it had a rechargeable battery .
__label__negative__ did n't fit my camera ti3
__label__positive__ the filter is quality made at a reasonable price . i use filters primarily to protect the expensive lenses that they are attached to from dust and debris .
__label__positive__ great backdrop we used at our wedding ! quick shipping too !
__label__positive__ this is great.. works great and very unassuming in the environment.. this is definitely the idea spy camera .
__label__positive__ fits my 35mm prime lens perfectly .
__label__positive__ how cool is this ? ? ? wi-fi enabled , great reception , superb video . all without having to string wires all over my house ! i can check from anywhere and best yet - install it myself ! ! technology really comes home in this amazing set up to give me peace of mind . ca n't say enough how much i love it .
__label__positive__ i ordered this for a cruise i am going on . connected it to mini qd loops1.5mm . did not want to use just the wrist strap for my camera . with the mini loops and the neck strap i ` m ready for the cruise . was delivered ahead of delivery date . had a little bit of a smell right out of the package . but it has been on my entertainment center for a month . no smell now .
__label__neutral__ material and color is good. < br / > issue : due to top zip while using frequently i am facing some issue , instead of zip if it will have flip button it will be the best product .
__label__negative__ case leaked and the picture quality was poor
__label__positive__ pretty much a good value . fairly complete package , although i am sure that eventually i will be upgrading some of the accessories .
__label__positive__ i really love all the smatree after market products for my gopro . all have great quality and great prices ... .i recommend them for anyone with a gopro .
__label__negative__ do n't be cheated by the ad . it is only 44 minutes , not 2-hour battery . it does n't have a cap to protect the battery either . the battery i received was different from the pics in the ad . on amazon. < br / > do n't wait your money .
__label__positive__ great product ! perfectly duited my needs !
__label__neutral__ made normally snug filters easily removable , but did not work on a filter stuck on lens , slid around filter .
__label__positive__ great product
__label__positive__ looks great in my family room - very unobtrusive .
__label__positive__ got as birthday present for nephew to encourage him to go outside and exercise - loves it .
__label__positive__ these batteries last forever ! i like these better than sonys rip off batteries at $ 80 a piece , seriously what were they thinking .
__label__positive__ i like it ! ! great flyer , very controllable , great range . camera not so great lots of jello in the video . but a & # 34 ; runcam & # 34 ; solved that problem .
__label__negative__ it 's a toy ... not professional ! does n't work !
__label__positive__ i am totally satisfied with my camera bag . so far i have placed in the bag , my canon rebel t5 body , the 18-55 mm lens and a 50mm lens , two batteries , the batteries charger , the usb cord and instruction manuals . this bag can hold more items as well . i placed one of the pads in the bottom of the bag to add more security to my camera .
__label__positive__ the pictures are very sharp . i have ditched the kit lens in favor of this lens .
__label__positive__ it was really nice ! ! i got it before the expected time arrival . i 'm going to buy more of these albums ! they are cute and make the polaroids easier to carry !
__label__positive__ good quality for the price .
__label__positive__ very unique ... amazing addition to my dslr.. i love filters .
__label__positive__ fast response and lense was new . works great !
__label__neutral__ it 's fine , just a pain to learn at first if you 're not tech savvy .
__label__positive__ just what i wanted .
__label__neutral__ the bag did n't even come close to holding the camera . very disappointed .
__label__positive__ came on time and works well
__label__positive__ i had a very quick response from the company . i was incorrect about there not being 2 pieces . the 2nd piece is film and , expecting glass , i did n't feel it in the pouch and threw it away . supposedly , the glass can be removed but i 'm afraid of damaging the camera so i wo n't try it unless it becomes necessary . therefore i 've changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars . the cardboard envelope says 2 pieces , there is only one . the instructions are for the film , not the glass . it is not removable , as stated . there are no instructions for the glass . as a result i am literally stuck with one on my brand new d810 and one on my brand new d750 . in a way , i 'm glad they left out the pieces for the top .
__label__positive__ for anyone rocking the tiagra shifters , these are amazing . i 'm able to get an unobstructed view by tucking the cables behind the gopro . they 're also forward enough that the hoods and the shifters do n't come into frame . i 'm happy that they included the allen key . if using the bolt is not your thing , standard gopro thumb screw works just as well. < br / > < br / > also , take care of the bolt . if you 're not riding with the gopro , road vibrations loosen the bolt and comes off , even if you tighten it .
__label__positive__ this bracket is very easy to use and work with flash unites ; the beauty is in its simplicity . i can see myself buying another one ...
__label__neutral__ it works as indicated but there is a noticeable reduction in the image quality
__label__positive__ excelent .
__label__positive__ had to modify a bit to fit on my tripod but it works perfectly
__label__positive__ excellent replacement
__label__positive__ i use these in my house with the staples connect hub . it helps me keep tabs on my house when i 'm not home . if i see motion , i can check a webcam and see what is going on . we have a small 6 pound cat that does n't set it off but adults and children do set it off . it is very responsive and the alerts that my staples connect hub send out are almost instant .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ great charger after having two others that burned up
__label__positive__ this is the picture for mine . it 's a simple hook up , but works great .
__label__positive__ it 's an authentic nikon battery , therefore works perfectly .
__label__positive__ first things first , i got my copy of lens on ebay , ( am sorry amazon ) ... i use my lens on a d5100 , yes i dont have autofocus on my dslr but i 'm okay with manual focussing with the help of lcd ... .if you are in search of a good lens with better versatility and need of some crazy bokeh ... . go for it ... you will not be disappointed < br / > < br / > pros : < br / > < br / > beautiful bokeh < br / > excellent sharpness ( i 'd razor sharp ) < br / > the pictures are contrasty ( imo ) < br / > macro capability at 35mm ( this is something i am very happy with you dont really need a pancake lens ) < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > < br / > it weighs a lot ( imo i love the camera and lens combo that weighs a lot they offer you better balance ) < br / > it lacks autofocus with all cheaper ones such as the d5xxx and d3xxx
__label__positive__ great buy . just what i wanted
__label__positive__ great product !
__label__neutral__ cheap kit .
__label__positive__ very easy to use , took it under water , great video ... .my friends were surprised by the clear pics
__label__positive__ these are good for eyeglasses , but not as good for ipads , iphones , etc.. the 3 & # 34 ; x3 & # 34 ; cleaning pads are great for ipads by boocgucbvi .
__label__positive__ i 'm a semi-serious shooter but was looking for a more simple p & s to carry in my bag . i did n't care about full manual control with this , and i wanted better photos than my cell phone produces. < br / > < br / > semi-short review . i 'm known for writing a thesis about a camera. < br / > < br / > this camera is an older model . if you want the latest , the model you want is the sx610 canon powershot sx610 hs ( red ) . an obvious difference i can see between this model and the sx610 is the sx610 has 20 mp . this older model could quite possibly take better photos with the 16 mp . higher mp is a marketing ploy that the camera manufacturers use on uninformed camera buyers . more mp does not mean better photos. < br / > < br / > made in japan ! ! ! need i say more , japanese-made cameras have never let me down. < br / > < br / > takes great pictures , bright , sharp and true-to-life , but if you 're a pixel-peeper , you wo n't be happy with photo quality ( you know who you are ! ) . for the rest of us , the photos are fine. < br / > < br / > fast focusing , fast to take the next shot. < br / > < br / > excellent battery life , over 300 photos on a single charge . battery charges outside the camera in a separate wall charger. < br / > < br / > smaller than i thought it would be , yet there is a rubber grip on the right front to help you hold it . the red version is glossy , the black camera is a matte finish which is easier to hold , and i 'm not sure about the white camera. < br / > < br / > the flash is a manual pop-up type , you press a button on the side of the camera . the lcd screen will tell you when the flash is needed . i like the manual control better , but you may not. < br / > < br / > you can zoom during a video , but unless you use a tripod for the full 18x zoom , your photo or video may be blurred or shaky . same with most any camera. < br / > < br / > no cd , you have to download the canon image software from their web site . i ca n't get it to work with windows 8.1 or windows 10 , but not a big deal to me since i use picasa and photoshop elements. < br / > < br / > you need to purchase an sdhc card , i recommend this. < br / > [ [ asin : b0064z71t8 kingston digital 16 gb sdhc/sdxc class 10 uhs-1 flash memory card 30mb/s ( sd10v/16gb ) ] ] < br / > < br / > i always recommend a case . this is a genuine olympus case with magnetic flap but there is no branding on it so it wo n't clash with the canon : ) and it fits this camera like a glove . the description says velcro but it 's magnetic. < br / > [ [ asin : b001rh82zu olympus horizontal neoprene and nylon case with velcro closure ( black ) ] ] to purchase an sdhc card , i recommend this. < br / > [ [ asin : b0064z71t8 kingston digital 16 gb sdhc/sdxc class 10 uhs-1 flash memory card 30mb/s ( sd10v/16gb ) ] ] < br / > < br / > i always recommend a case . this is a genuine olympus case with magnetic flap but there is no branding on it so it wo n't clash with the canon : ) and it fits this camera like a glove . the description says velcro but it 's magnetic. < br / > [ [ asin : b001rh82zu olympus horizontal neoprene and nylon case with velcro closure ( black ) ] ]
__label__negative__ worthless junk . did n't last three months . do n't waste your money !
__label__positive__ i picked one of these up so that i can attach my dslr to a century stand ( c-stand ) and use it as a tripod . with this camera bracket attached to the arm on the c-stand , i can hoist the camera up and shoot straight-down for certain jobs . perfect .
__label__positive__ i love it .
__label__positive__ the fujicam 361 hd ( now vimtag ) is a great indoor camera.for some reason those reviews are showing up for the vimtag b1 outdoor camera ! just received the b1 , not happy with installation instructions , there was nothing telling you how to mount it ! data and other cords are open to elements , must protect somehow.you ca n't drill hole through house to run wires , this would be a fire hazard , trying to figure out a waterproof enclosure .
__label__positive__ love the camera had it a few months only downfall is the bag has already broke .
__label__positive__ pros : very decent system . works well , images are good . easy to set up . i have installed about 20 of these zmodo systems and all about the same . tech support when i needed it was helpful. < br / > cons : camera mounts are cheap . ca n't crank them down , the metal is a little thin . video cable are short , only 65 ft. from the basement , to the attic and across the house you need extensions .
__label__neutral__ pros : < br / > -compact , high-quality frame < br / > -super-versatile lens < br / > < br / > cons : < br / > -limited dynamic range at higher iso < br / > -no raw support < br / > -noisy , low-detail images at higher iso < br / > < br / > if flexibility across light conditions is of more importance then you 'd be better considering this one : http : //amzn.to/1isk4h0
__label__neutral__ easy to set up . picture quality ok
__label__negative__ slow camera . it is easy to miss shots waiting for the camera to load . battery compartment spring is so strong that the plastic bit that holds the battery compartment closed sheared off . this is a cheap camera built cheaply and is not very sturdy . its performance is pretty poor even compared to cheaper nikon models . i do n't recommend it .
__label__neutral__ hard to remove ! excellent fit and quality
__label__positive__ i brought this harness to botswana with me , and ended up lending it to a 67 yr old woman who was complaining of neck pain from the weight of her binoculars hanging from her neck strap . once she put her binoculars on this harness , she had instant and total relief of her neck pain ! her husband said that it saved the trip for them . i let her keep the harness , and will be ordering another one for myself .
__label__positive__ i bought 3 sets from different places , i recommend this one the most , because of : < br / > < br / > - the packaging was the best , they made sure the lenses are packed safe . ( the others packed all the lenses in one plastic bag without any wrapping ) < br / > - one of the employees send me an email with all the information i need if anything went wrong. < br / > - there is no black circle around the picture when using the wide angle lens like the other brands ( used with iphone 5 - 6 and samsung s4 )
__label__neutral__ as ip cameras go , this one is okay . it frequently stops sending to the internet , but can still be viewed if you are on the same network , which means it still saves motion detected to the d-link dvr . picture quality is okay , both day and night .
__label__positive__ the batteries are perfect plus with a life time guarantee you can not beat the price or the warranty .
__label__positive__ they work awesome , i will recomended this product to everybody .
__label__positive__ great
__label__positive__ i love my polaroid
__label__positive__ great lights . they are a little tricky to assemble but the quality is impressive for the price . it comes with rear and front diffusers and the grid which is very important to control the light spill . i recommend to anyone on a budget .
__label__negative__ it 's ok if it worked as promised . it came with 2 memory cards and the camera would n't format either one . canon tech support suggested buying another card to try . i did , it did n't . i will try to take it to a photo shop to see if i 'm doing something wrong before i return it , but i know ifollowed the instructions to the letter .
__label__positive__ this is a great charger . the price was right . the quality was right . the charger comes with a car charger and a charger adapter that is compatible for europe . also the charger has a built in plug so you never have to worry about finding the other cable to the charger . there is no need to buy another battery from somewhere else . anywhere else it is 3 times more expensive . do n't buy from anywhere but wasabi power .
__label__positive__ this is my 3rd gps unit to try and , so far , this one is the best . ca n't say if it 's accurate or not , but it does n't fall off the camera and it does n't make my camera malfuntion ( like a couple other units did ) .
__label__positive__ super easy set up/configuration . the image quality is quite remarkable - love that i can see lots of detail when away from home . nice wide angle on the camera too . in low light situations i still get a clear shot . two way audio allows me to freak the dogs out too ! very impressed .
__label__neutral__ well , i 'm not amazed . sometimes they power up ( lights turn on ) and other times they do n't ( is it still on , just not the lights ? ) not a very well tuned machine , i would urge buyers to pass on this one . too bad there are n't many options for buying small power packs like this one . where 's the good stuff from reputable brands ? ?
__label__positive__ i bought this product for some tabletop product photography . i needed a white , seamless background and diffuse light . this product worked great , especially for the price ! i paid $ 20 and would happily do so again .
__label__negative__ mine will not charge any of my 3 batteries . they fit fine in the charging port but they will not charge and no light comes on . what do i do .
__label__positive__ this is the first day with my nikon . it was so simple to set the date , mode settings etc . i 've been out taking photos to get used to using a screen instead of the viewfinder which my pervious camera had . i am impressed with the detail and clarity of the photos today . i 'm looking forward to taking wonderful pictures with it . the instruction manual that came with it is reader friendly !
__label__positive__ shipped right on time ! amazing product . bought this set for my trip . all the components are great quality .
__label__positive__ good product .
__label__positive__ it does its job for it 's price . no complain at all . i have a canon sd 1200 is that i bought from 2010. i used it on my vacation earlier this month in dr. brought it to the beach and snorkel . i used the small sponge that came with and some paper tissue to make sure the camera fit inside and did not move around . it 's hard to see the screen due to reflection . but i still got nice shots . i am happy with this product !
__label__positive__ actually has three mounts !
__label__positive__ it fits smoothly , charges quickly , and works perfectly . the packaging was more secure and more thoughtfully designed than you usually get for a battery . update : 10/27/2015 . this battery holds a charger far longer than the one it replaced .
__label__positive__ perfect .
__label__positive__ great quality , made to last .
__label__positive__ great wee bundle for its price
__label__positive__ cool drone bundle ! its great to have extra batteries and accessories .
__label__positive__ fast shipping and works as promised . my camera was unusable without this so i 'm happy to have it !
__label__negative__ not for phantom 3 as described
__label__positive__ it 's handy and compact , but sometimes the camera makes it too top-heavy if you 're using it as a tripod ... the little legs are not enough of a base . works well for hand extension though !
__label__neutral__ not as heavy duty as i 'd hoped . i think it 's a nice tripod .
__label__positive__ much smaller and lighter than the one that came with the camera . liked it so much , i bought a second as a backup . much less expensive than the oem charger as well .
__label__positive__ super helpful ! used it for my camera and sure enough , works great ! : )
__label__positive__ great value , awesome quality
__label__positive__ great price , good quality outdoor camera . it is n't a 1080p camera , but remember the price ... ir distance is good , not 110 feet though .
__label__negative__ i have been so completely disappointed by this that i felt the need to review it . i will say the system itself appears to do what it says , if you can get it to work . i am not opposed to working out bugs in a system , especially if it can save me a few bucks and in all honesty it is not the & # 34 ; bugs & # 34 ; that have disappointed me as much as the customer service . when you install the system , you are given two numbers to call if you experience problems . one if you have an actual alarm problem and the other if you have a problem with the system or installation . in numerous places it tells you not to call the alarm number with a system problem as they will not be able to help you . i get that . but if you have a system problem , you ca n't get anyone to answer . the first time we had an issue , we called during published business hours and got a recording stating that it might be 24 hours before we got a call back . we thought that was weird and a little unsettling , but ok . the second time i called it was because my system had stopped monitoring . ( less than a week from install ) once again , had to leave a message because even though you hang on the line for 20 minutes , no one picks up . got a call back a couple of hours later . they checked their system and agreed that the system was not monitoring . they said they would overnight a new base module and then when he realized we did not live at the house that was being monitored ( remodeling project ) he stated he would change it to 2 day delivery . i explained that i needed the system working as no one was there and it was important to be monitored , he agreed to overnight as originally stated . this conversation was at 11:00 am cst . i receive notification the next day that the base had been shipped 2 business day ( on a thursday ) which means i wo n't receive till monday . totally unacceptable ! ! ! not even the best of products can survive poor customer service . these guys need to get their act together . if having a system that you can get up and running quickly is important to you , do yourself a favor and move on to something else .
__label__positive__ arrived on time ; perfect fit for the canon lp-e5 battery ; got two batteries and a charger replacment for a fraction of the cost canon would charge ; came with car charging capabilities in case the plug goes bad again like my stock canon charger ( back up plan ) .

__label__positive__ perfect weight and balance
__label__positive__ this kit is wonderful . i bought it for my camera that i 'm using for photography school and so far it 's worth the money .
__label__positive__ perfect weight and size for my camera
__label__positive__ ca n't go wrong with this cover . easy to put on and protect very well .
__label__positive__ best purchase ever ! so glad we bought this before our trip ! it took great pictures and worked great under water and never leaked !
__label__positive__ works great .
__label__neutral__ strap that holds the hook broke off , not to sturdy . outside of that it serves it 's purpose
__label__neutral__ has cosmetic imperfections
__label__positive__ the suction cup on the bottom of this is very good and strong . it sticks well to or car dashboard and does n't move at all . the holder is strong and tight , yet easily adjustable with the push of a button . the holder looks a little big and bulky on our dashboard , but it does the job well. < br / > < br / > my husband and i both have moto g phones and they fit well . my husband has a case on his and it sticks out a little further than mine does without the case . so this is not great for thicker phones ( unless you do n't mind it sticking out a little in the holder ) . it feels like it 's made with quality , durable material and not cheap . it 's easy to use . i 'd definitely recommend it. < br / > < br / > i received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest , unbiased review . all opinions are 100 % mine .
__label__positive__ very happy with my purchase took it on vacation and hiked and biked with it
__label__positive__ everything fits nicely . but smaller would be nicer , except i have a tendency to take everything that i have . decisions , decisions .
__label__positive__ i ended up returning this item only because it was not appropriate for the size of our system . otherwise , it provided a nice spotlight for our cameras .
__label__positive__ works great and comes with a ton of mounting options
__label__positive__ me being one that likes to record on the daily basis , as well as having friends who do production work , this has proved to work very well in my opinion . it ’ s easy to use and the quality was more than what i had expected it to be . i highly recommend getting this if anyone else is also into taking photos or like to make videos . it ’ s was definitely worth it .
__label__positive__ excellent filter , have not had any flare / or dust issues . also very easy to clean , and stays clean .
__label__positive__ great value !
__label__positive__ excelente
__label__positive__ works perfectly , battery indicator works !
__label__positive__ worked great ,
__label__positive__ i love , love , love this lens ! ! it 's perfect for portraits . ca n't say enough good things about it !
__label__positive__ exactly what i needed . fast delivery !
__label__positive__ great lens clothes , just the right size .
__label__positive__ better than i thought
__label__positive__ very nice
__label__positive__ worked great for glacier hike !
__label__positive__ i love this camera . stepped up from a rebel t3i ( which i love and still use as a backup body ) . love the speed and the low light ability . great pro-sumer camera . wifi addition is tremendous and allows me to use my iphone as a remote . love it .
__label__positive__ great tripod and with wheels that make filming convenient & professional feel
__label__positive__ i like the camera , lots of options . the manual is on the disk .
__label__negative__ the filters did fit , but not securely the go pro 4 . no way they would fit the go pro 3 , so i indeed received the correct filters . the red dive filter was so red , it pretty much blacked out my dive on 1080p 60fps and on 1080p 30fps in 100 foot of water . remove the filter , the go pro shoots perfectly fine with tons of natural light being let into the lens . i did not use artificial light .
__label__negative__ i 'm not so sure if this is an authentic joby product . from the first few seconds that i had my hands on it , the lock/unlock ring for the base broke off . i think it shifted to the lock position before it broke off , which is good . since it does hold my phone fine i will keep it and use it until it breaks . would advise others not to buy since i 'll probably have to buy another one in a couple of weeks .
__label__positive__ i love companies that under promise and over deliver , which is the case with this purchase . the bag arrived today , although it says i should n't receive it until the end of august or middle of september. < br / > first things first < br / > the bag looks just like the photos . i did n't notice any stains for discolorations . it does have a funny smell but i 'm sure it 's the dye used to treat the leather . i would purchase this bag again in a minute . ca n't wait to see how many people ask where i got it.. thanks ! !
__label__positive__ it fits in very nicely with my new hero 4 silver .
__label__positive__ great quality case , perfect for boating , kayaking , and snowmobiling . i use it to keep my phone , wallet , and keys safe and dry . i have tested by swimming down 10ft with the case empty , not a drop inside .
__label__neutral__ love the camera . now , i bought because so many people said install was easy . it was not . the firmware is out of date requiring 15 minutes on hold and 20 minutes with india support . not sure the purpose of the cd either as the latest install is on the dlink website . very frustrating dlink ! ! 😠
__label__positive__ excellent , delivered on time , was as described , great customer service ( if contacted )
__label__positive__ works as advertised , just barely fits around my 2 & # 34 ; ski bar .
__label__positive__ probably my fault but it is a little small for my camera , i have a big body cannon digital . works well , your rebel will fit fine , ( as my little camera so does mine ) holds my camera gear , only adds 20 lbs to me when i have it all on , and it works as described . i can get the camera out with the bag still strapped to me , it just is on the wrong side so i make it a little awkward .
__label__positive__ i love these glasses they r perfect i use the to drive and on my mini segway
__label__negative__ not sure if mine is a defective unit or if it falls in the category of others who had units that just did not preform . the unit would work on extremely bright images in the sky but that was it . jupiter and saturn , nope , camera would not even turn on . very disappointed as i have many good products from orion . as others have said this camera has a low light threshold , if i would shine a light down the telescope tube the camera would activate , without the outside light it would not .
__label__positive__ great item ! great seller !
__label__positive__ same battery kind that came with my canon rebel xt slr , but for a fraction of the price . came quickly too !
__label__negative__ tiny slippery piece of plastic ( 1 1/2 & # 34 ; long ) , not silicone as described ! total waste of money ! i 've been had !
__label__negative__ two months after installation the hard-drive stop working , ca n't get help from zmodo , email only support. < br / > i do not recommend this system , poor quality and no service .
__label__positive__ if you are a camera user , you are going to use it with the special strap . best bang for the buck
__label__positive__ i mainly got this to see if it fit on my gopro hero4 session since i wanted to protect the lense when i carry it in my pockets or bag and guess what.. fits perfectly ! ! i love that this a gel cover so it fits and stays snug . def recommended for a gopro hero4 session ! there are basically zero cases for the session at the moment so this was perfect !
__label__positive__ i normally do n't leave reviews , but this security system merrited it ... the resulution is not 1080 , but the image definitely looks crisp ... the length of the cables are more than enough ... and the setup was pretty straight foward ...
__label__positive__ the underwater case functioned flawlessly at 90+ feet - which was the main reason to get this combination . the focus is relatively fast and the lens is sharp . added bonus is a real optical viewfinder . these are almost unavailable nowadays .
__label__positive__ excellent and robust product but a little disappointed in the 'speed between photos ' - there is a clear delay between shooting and the camera being ready to take the next photo .
